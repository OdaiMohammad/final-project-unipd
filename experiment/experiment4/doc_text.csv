Widely dispersed fragmented populations are a challenge to monitor because sub-
population sizes may be very small, dif ﬁcult to access and time consuming to sam-
ple regularly."
"We use the coconut crab ( Birgus latro ) on Pemba, United Republic
of Zanzibar as a case study for estimating highly fragmented populations and meta-population sizes."
"The species is a very large terrestrial decapod threatened by
exploitation and habitat alteration and now classi ﬁed as vulnerable."
"We developed
an integrated model to analyse capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from ﬁve sites
jointly with count data from 24 sites to estimate site-level densities and populationsizes, predicted total population size across the Pemba archipelago, and investigated
the effect of six predictors of human in ﬂuence on density."
"We ﬁtted separate
models to test the effect of the same predictors on raw counts and individual bodymass."
"We estimate the total population of coconut crabs on the Pemba archipelago
to be c. 6700 terrestrial individuals."
"We show that government protection generally
affects crabs positively, whereas presence of agriculture negatively affects theirdensities."
"This study highlights that time-consuming CMR data can be leveraged to
estimate densities on less visited sites, and that fully protected islands are critical
for maintaining relatively high population densities."
"Our overall population estimatesuggests that Pemba still hosts a viable coconut crab population in a part of itsrange where the species is otherwise in steep decline.
"
"Introduction
As populations become ever more fragmented, they are
increasingly challenging to monitor because isolated subpop-
ulations can be dif ﬁcult to reach and their dwindling sizes
can result in sparse data being collected."
"Nonetheless, the
sizes of small subpopulations are important especially if they
are connected through immigration and are capable of reco-lonizing each other (metapopulations, Hanski & Simberl-
off,1997 )."
"Sometimes fragmented populations enjoy partial
protection in one part of their range but not elsewhere andthese protected subpopulations can potentially act as sources
in a metapopulation (Hansen, 2011 )."
"This makes it particu-
larly important to know the subpopulation sizes of thosefragments under protection.
"
"One major challenge in estimating population size is that
of imperfect detection —we cannot know whether we havecounted all individuals in the sampled population, and in
most cases, we likely have not."
"Capture-mark-recapture(CMR) models (Otis et al .,1978 ) are the gold standard of
abundance estimation but require repeated visits to sampling
sites, which is challenging if the number of subpopulationsto monitor is numerous and their locations are remote or
widely dispersed."
"These models also require suf ﬁcient indi-
viduals to be captured and recaptured, which is especiallydifﬁcult to achieve at depauperate sites.
"
"Jointly analysing data from all subpopulations in a hierar-
chical CMR model (Converse & Royle, 2012 ) can address
the challenges of sparse data for some subpopulations."
"These
models allow sharing information on detection probability
among subpopulations, thus enabling detection-corrected esti-mates of abundance even for subpopulations where data aresparse."
"In the context of metapopulation estimation, however,
subpopulation level observations may range from CMR data

size of some subpopulations."
"Integrated models can combine
such disparate data within a single statistical model (e.g.
Schaub & Abadi, 2011 ; Zipkin et al.,2021 )."
"The framework
leverages high-resolution information often only available at
small scales (e.g. CMR data, systematic species occurrence
surveys) and combines it with lower resolution data (e.g.counts, opportunistic occurrence data) that can be collectedat larger scales, to assess population status and dynamics at
large spatio-temporal scales (e.g. Chandler & Clark, 2014 ;
Paciﬁciet al.,2017 )."
"This makes integrated modelling a suit-
able framework for metapopulation estimation and
monitoring.
"
"Here, we present a test case of subpopulation estimation
using a rare arthropod species to exemplify how integrating
CMR and count data can address the challenges of data dis-
parity among subpopulations."
"We further provide a baselineestimate of the coconut crab ( Birgus latro ) population on
Pemba, Zanzibar, one of its last strongholds in the Western
Indian Ocean, against which future monitoring efforts can becompared.
"
"Coconut crabs are the world ’s largest terrestrial arthropod
reaching 4 kg in body mass and 1 m in leg span (Brown &
Fielder, 1991 ; Drew et al .,2010 )."
"Following a short larval
stage at sea, individuals move on to land, where very young
stages carry an empty mollusc shell, and generally remain
in coastal scrub or forest for the rest of their lives, neverentering water again (Brown & Fielder, 1991 )."
"Coconut
crabs are almost immune to natural predation but are threat-
ened by anthropogenic exploitation for food and habitatdestruction owing to agricultural expansion and coastal
housing and hotel development (Cumberlidge et al .,2022 ).
"
"Now, virtually extirpated from continental landmasses, coco-nut crabs are mostly found on island archipelagos across theIndian Ocean and Western Paci ﬁc Ocean."
"As a result of
these threats, this species has recently been upgraded from
‘Data De ﬁcient ’to ‘Vulnerable ’on the IUCN Red List
(Cumberlidge, 2020 ).
"
"Coconut crab populations on most island archipelagos in
the Western Indian Ocean are in steep decline or else extir-pated (Cumberlidge et al .,2022 )."
"Despite this, the species
still survives on some coastal East African islands and on
Unguja and Pemba, Zanzibar, although principally on outly-ing smaller islands off the Zanzibari coastline (Caroet al .,2021 ; Hamad et al .,2023 )."
"Here, our aim was to:
Estimate the abundance and density of coconut crabs on the
main island of Pemba and its outlying islands (Fig. 1),
investigate the effect of six predictors of human in ﬂuence on
density and derive a total population size for the Pemba
archipelago."
"To do so, we build an integrated model combin-ing data from CMR surveys of ﬁve coconut crab subpopula-
tions with count surveys from 24 additional subpopulations
within or near the Pemba archipelago."
"We focus here on esti-
mating population sizes, but the ﬂexible modelling approach
can form the basis of regional metapopulation monitoring,
for harvesting or setting quotas, and can be adapted to othermetapopulation estimation situations."
"Materials and methods
Study sites
The research was principally conducted on the island ofPemba and its outlying islands in the United Republic ofZanzibar archipelago, across 29 sites."
"Pemba (988 km
2,2 6
of the sampled sites) is an oceanic island lying 50 km east
of the Tanzania mainland."
The island is hilly with fertilesoil.
"Pemba is dominated by small-scale farming of cassava,
tomatoes, bananas, with cloves ( Syzygium aromaticum )a s
the cash crop."
It has a large human population of 400 000people.
"Unguja (1666 km
2, one sampled site), the other main
island in the Zanzibar archipelago, is a Landbridge island
lying 59 km to the south."
"The island is ﬂat and relies
heavily on the tourism industry as well as ﬁshing and con-
siderable seaweed farming; 900 000 people live there."
"Two
uninhabited islands in the Dar es Salaam Marine Reserve
system were also sampled for crabs (Fig. 1); these islands
comprise sandy and rocky karst beaches with mostly sandy
interiors.
"
"Field data collection
TC conducted searches of adult coconut crabs (de ﬁned as
individuals that had lost their gastropod shell and were fully
terrestrial) on all sites (Fig. 1), several repeatedly, between
July 2016 and August 2022; JZ surveyed Misali Island in
April 2022; and L-MG visited Chumbe in June –July 2022
(for details on surveys, see Appendix S1, Tables S1and S2).
"
"Survey periods were principally in the early part of the dry
season to maximize the number of nights that could be spent
searching in the ﬁeld, except for Misali which was surveyed
in the wet season."
"Sampling sites were identi ﬁed based on
local information, and areas to search within those sites were
chosen by local ﬁshermen or farmers familiar with the area
and who usually took part in the surveys."
"Groups of betweenone and six persons (mean =2.57/C61.26 persons; N=154
nights) conducted crab surveys along transects or within
search areas."
"Surveyors, spread out and equipped withtorches, walked slowly starting between 19.15 and 20.30 h
and continued for 2 –4.5 h."
"We recorded total search effort
daily as total time spent in the ﬁeld.
"
"Once detected, each crab was captured and placed in a
bucket, weighed, sexed and measured."
"Before release, it was
photographed and marked with a uniquely assigned numberusing a white marker (Edding 950 industrial painter)"
"lastingthe length of a survey (maximum 3 months), so that subse-
quent recaptures could be identi ﬁed (see also Oka et al .,
2013 ).
"
"Surveys consisted of one or multiple visits (de ﬁned as one
night searching, also referred to as sampling occasions) to the
same site within a season (between December and April, orbetween June and September)."
"There were four types of sur-
veys: (i) on Pemba mainland sites conducted by TC (Fig. 1),
usually repeated sampling occasions separated by a minimumof a week, with total survey length not exceeding 3 months; (ii)

consisting of two such bouts within 2 months; and (iv) on Mis-
ali and Chumbe islands by JZ and L-MG, repeat sampling occa-sions, approximately twice or once per week, respectively, andover a span of 3 –11 weeks respectively.
"
"Modelling framework
We approached our objective in two steps, implemented in a
Bayesian framework: (1) Fitting an integrated model that
combines closed population CMR modelling (Otiset al .,1978 ) for a subset of surveys with appropriate data,
and N-mixture modelling (Royle, 2004a ) for the remaining
surveys, to estimate density and its drivers across sampledsites; (2) using posterior prediction from the integrated modelto extrapolate abundance to suitable habitat throughout the
sampled sites.
"
"Population closure
CMR models assume that populations are closed (i.e. do
not change) over the course of a survey."
"We are con ﬁdentthat within the maximum 3-month survey duration recruit-
ment into the sampled ‘adult ’population (having discarded
their mollusc shell) was negligible since very small individ-uals were rarely caught."
"Crabs are nocturnal so suffer little
avian predation and there are virtually no mammalian pred-
ators on small islands in our study area (Foleyet al .,2014 ) with the possible exception of rats ( Rattus
rattus ) on some islands (e.g. Mapanya and Misali) that
may take small coconut crabs ( <0.15 kg)"
"lacking mollusc
shells."
"The main source of mortality of coconut crabs isharvest by humans but offtake is infrequent and irregular
on most islands even where they are persecuted by chil-
dren, with only two dead crabs encountered during 7 yearsof study."
"Closure can also be violated by movement off
the search area."
"Several sampled sites were on very small
islands ( <20 ha) or surrounded by unsuitable habitat (see
deﬁnition below) with little room for crab movement
(<15 ha) such as Verani (see Table 1); however, there may
have been movement off the search area on larger islands
(e.g. KP Matumbini, Misali, Fundo and Ngao)."
"This is acommon problem in studies applying CMR or N-mixture
models; however, as long as movement in and out of the
search area is random, this lack of closure does not biasestimates of the number of animals that use the search area
(Kendall, 1999 ).

"Buffering is necessary to account for individual movementon and off the search area (Otis et al .,1978 ; Wilson &
Anderson, 1985 )."
"Typically, these buffers are thought to rep-
resent an average home-range radius but information oncoconut crab movement is sparse."
"Typical movement radiirange from <10 m (Fletcher, Brown, & Fielder, 1990 ; Helf-
man, 1973 ; Oka et al.,2016 ) to 62 m (Krieger et al.,2012 ),
with long distance movements of several km (Krieger
et al .,2012 )."
"In one of our own surveys, the maximum
recapture distance was 226 m, with an average of 46 m. Tobe conservative in the sense of not overestimating crab
populations, we opted for a 100-m buffer."
"This is necessarily
subjective and choosing a different buffer would alter esti-mates of densities and population sizes."
"By adopting oneconsistent buffer, we aim to make density estimates compara-

and were thus equal to the total area of suitable habitat of
that site."
"But many (generally island) sites had suitable habi-
tat beyond the sampled area."
"For these sites, we de ﬁned the
total area of suitable habitat as the total island area minus
area covered by houses, agriculture or mangroves."
"Sampled
areas and total area of suitable habitat were mapped out inGoogle Earth (14 December 2015 version) to determine theirsize in ha.
"
"Integrated model
We developed a hierarchical integrated model that allowed
us to estimate site-level abundance and density combining
data from the different types of surveys described above."
"Broadly, we divided surveys into CMR and count surveys.
"
"Three issues prevented us from treating all surveys as CMR
surveys: (1) before 2018, surveys did not reliably keep trackof individual crab identity; (2) many surveys consisted of asingle visit; (3) many surveys had no recaptures."
"We identi-
ﬁedﬁve sites with 22 post-2017 multiple-visit surveys and
at least one recapture (Appendix S1, Table S1): Swahili
Divers, Verani, Kigomasha (Pemba mainland), Chumbe and
Misali (islands, Fig. 1)."
"For these surveys, we developed a
CMR observation model."
"For all other count surveys, wedeveloped an N-mixture (Royle, 2004a ) observation model.
"
"Whereas it is conceptually possible to develop an all-CMR
model including single-visit surveys and surveys withoutrecaptures, such a model would have to exclude 16 pre-
2018 surveys (or 21% of all surveys), which is not
desirable, especially in a sparse data situation like ours."
"Moreover, the loss of information in N-mixture models (dueto ignoring individual identity) only occurs in count surveys
with >1 visits; only 38% of count surveys had >1 visit.
"
"Finally, trials with an all-CMR model suggested it would bemuch slower to ﬁt (i.e. multiple days with a 2.6 GHz pro-
cessor with 64 GB RAM if chains can be run in parallel)
than our combined model (several hours)."
"An all-N-mixturemodel, on the other hand, would forego the information
contained in the more detailed individual encounter data
used in CMR models."
"Therefore, we opted for this hybridapproach.

"This ‘Null model ’can be expanded to
include site-level covariates (see Drivers of density)."
"Model-
ling of the latent realized survey-level abundance, Nj,
depends on the observation model."
"CMR observation model
For the 22 surveys identi ﬁed as suitable for CMR analysis, we
compiled individual encounter histories, marking whether or
not an individual crab ihad been detected ( yijk¼1) or not
(yijk¼0) on visit knested within survey j."
"These observations
are modelled as Bernoulli random variables with success
probability =detection probability, pjk."
"We estimated pjkon
the logit scale as a function of visit-level effort (duration of aﬁeld visit in minutes, divided by 100 to avoid numerical issues
with very small coef ﬁcients)."
"Because survey-level data were
fairly sparse (Appendix S2, Table S1), we estimated detection
parameters (intercept and effect of effort) for each site but keptthem constant for all surveys within a site."
"Most searches were
implemented by TC, except for three on Misali by JZ and one
on Chumbe by L-MG."
"To account for potential different detec-tion parameters due to different observer skill level and varia-
tion in sampling protocol, we estimated separate detection
parameters for observers; for simplicity, that is omitted from thefollowing equation.

"We arrived at the detection model structure
using maximum likelihood analysis of only the CMR surveydata and AIC-based model selection, described in
Appendix S2.
"
"We estimated abundance for each CMR survey using data
augmentation (Royle, Dorazio, & Link, 2007 )."
"In data aug-
mentation, the n

vey are augmented up to a large number, Mj, with all-0

 Here, p.index is a site-speci ﬁc index for pre-2018 surveys
from the ﬁve sites included in the CMR observation model
(so that the site-speci ﬁc detection parameters are used); for
all other surveys, β0 and βwere de ﬁned as the average
detection parameters ( α0 and α) over all surveys implemen-
ted by TC (as all non-CMR surveys were implemented by
TC)."
"As these averages are calculated at each iteration of theMCMC algorithm, error in α0 and αis fully propagated to
β0 and β.
"
"We modelled abundance N
jas a negative binomial ran-
dom variable with mean λjfrom equation 1:
Nj∼NegBin λj,r/C0/C1
Here, ris the overdispersion parameter of the negative
binomial distribution."
"The negative binomial distribution canbe thought of as a Poisson-Gamma mixture, where the Pois-
son mean is a random variable with a Gamma distribution.
"
"Thus, this realized abundance model mirrors the one for theCMR observation model, treating expected abundance as arandom variable to better account for variation in N
jamong
surveys.
"
"Drivers of density
In addition to the ‘Null model ’for expected abundance
described in equation 1, we also ﬁt models (with identical
offset and random effect structure) testing the effect of six
site-speci ﬁc binary covariates on density."
"This analysis
expands on a previous analysis of catch per unit effort(CPUE) data and body mass across a subset of 12 sites(Caro et al.,2021 )."
"According to those results, we expected
density to be lower at sites with presence of ﬁshermen
camping overnight and nearby permanent settlements (i.e.within walking distance: 3 km); and higher at sites with
presence of agriculture (beans, maize, tomatoes or casava
planted in adjacent agricultural land), unof ﬁcial protection
within or near hotel grounds, being located on islands which
are less in ﬂuenced by humans, and having government pro-
tection."
"We only ﬁt single-covariate models, because number
of sites in some of these binary categories was low(Appendix S1, Table S2).
"
"Posterior prediction of population size in suitable
habitat
To obtain estimates of total abundance across all sampled
sites, N:totS, for all sites except Chumbe, we multiplied site-
level density Dswith the total area of suitable habitat at that
site."
"For Chumbe, all searches were performed in the ‘lodge
area ’, the area of highest crab density on the island."
"To esti-
mate population size for the remaining northern and southern
parts of the island, we used reported proportions of crabscaptured (73.8% in the lodge area, 8.9% in the north, 17.3%
in the south) in an earlier study that sampled all three
regions (Kilstromer & Bergwall, 2013 )."
"We calculated
expected abundance in the lodge area, N
L, according to
equation 1; expected abundance in the south and north,NSN¼NL8:9þ17:3 ðÞ
73:8, and N:tot¼NLþNSN."
"This approach
depends on the assumption that (a) Kilstromer & Berg-
wall ( 2013 ) searched similar sized areas in all regions so that
number of crabs captured was not affected by size of thesampled area and (b) that capture probability was similar in
the three regions."
"Neither assumption can be tested; but the
alternative of using lodge-area density for the entirety ofChumbe would severely overestimate total population size."
"Finally, to obtain total population size for the Pemba archi-
pelago, N
Pemba, we summed N:tot over all sites that are part
of the archipelago (Table 1)."
"We performed all calculations
on 5000 randomly selected posterior samples of the inte-
grated model without covariates.
"
"Note that our focus is on estimating population size,
rather than change in population over time."
"We therefore
base our abundance estimate on the site-level expected abun-
dance, which is constant over time."
"This means that subpop-ulation estimates refer to different time scales (for single
survey sites, they represent that point in time only, whereas
for multiple survey sites, they represent an average over sur-veys)."
"As there is no survey period in which all sites werevisited, estimating abundances for a uni ﬁed time frame is
not possible with the present model and data.
"
"Models of crab counts and body mass
Further expanding on the analysis by Caro et al.,2021 ,w e
also tested the effect of the six potential drivers of densityon raw crab counts and body mass (in kg)."
"We analysed raw
counts to ensure that results can be compared to potential
future studies that may not want (or be able) to estimateabundance/density."
"We modelled survey-level counts (i.e.aggregated across visits) as negative binomial random vari-
ables with total survey-level effort as offset."
"This is akin to
modelling counts per unit effort, where a unit effort is100 min of ﬁeld work."
"Body mass is a measure of body size
(Sato et al .,2013 ) which is a predictor of reproductive
potential of coconut crabs (e.g. Sato & Suzuki, 2010 ) and
thus an additional important indicator of subpopulation sta-
tus."
"We modelled square root-transformed body mass as nor-
mal random variables; we allowed for site-speci ﬁc residual
variances to account for heteroscedasticity."
"We only includedbody mass measures from surveys carried out by TC to
maintain consistency."
"We expected the same effects for
counts and body mass as described for density."
"All modelscontained a site random effect; models for body mass also
contained an effect of sex since the species is sexually
dimorphic.
"
"Model implementation
We implemented all models in Nimble (de Valpineet al.,2017 ) using the R package nimble ver. 0.12.2"

pine et al.,2022 ) in R ver."

"We
ran three parallel chains, each with 100 000 (integrated
models) or 75 000 (count, body mass models) iterations, ofwhich we discarded 50 000 as burn-in and thinned the
remaining iterations at a rate of 10."

rior mode and 90% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) because

"
"Results
The 22 surveys with suitable data for CMR analysis con-tained encounter histories for 624 individual crabs, of which
93 were recaptured at least once (Appendix S2, Table S1).
"
"For the remaining 53 surveys, capture numbers per samplingoccasion ranged from 0 (11 surveys across nine sites) to 19;
six sites (all surveyed only once) had no captures at all
(Appendix S1, Table S1).
"
"Coconut crab density
Estimates of density from the integrated model without cov-
ariates for the Chumbe lodge area (41.97 crabs/ha; 90%BCI: 31.93 –55.92) (Table 1) were three times higher than
the next site and much higher than elsewhere."
"Other sites
had densities <10 crabs/ha, except for Manta Cave, Pemba
Paradise (a hotel site) and Mapanya island, likely due to
small search areas and few visits (Appendix S1, Table S1).
"
"Abundance across suitable habitat
Site-level (i.e. subpopulation) abundance estimates across
suitable habitat from posterior predictions ranged from 1.4individuals (90% BCI: 0.33 –23.95) on the small (2.7 ha)
island of Hamisi to 2713.59 individuals (90% BCI: 1948.04 –
4762.20) on the 731-ha uninhabited island of Matumbini KP.
"
"Uncertainty for many abundance estimates was high (widthof 90% BCI >>estimate) but decreased as the number of
surveys at a site increased (Appendix S1, Figure S1)."
"The
total (meta-)population size of coconut crabs in the Pembaarchipelago was estimated at 6687.97 individuals (90% BCI:
5050.58 –10443.55).
"
"Drivers of density
The strongest predictor of crab density ( p(≠0)=0.98) was
the presence of agriculture (Table 2); contrary to expecta-
tions, agriculture affected density negatively."
"Fishermen,hotels ( p(≠0)=0.96) and government protection ( p(≠0)
=0.91) all affected density positively; for ﬁshermen, this
again went against our expectations."
"Effects of being on anisland or having nearby human settlements had less support
(smaller coef ﬁcients, proportionally larger
SD,p(≠0)≤0.87).
"
"Drivers of crab counts and body mass
The strongest predictors of counts per unit effort (with p
(≠0)≥0.98) were government protection (positive), presence
of agriculture and settlements (both negative; Table 2)."
"Ana-
lysing the body mass of 795 crabs caught across 23 sites,government protection was the strongest predictor ( p(≠0)
=1) and, as expected, affected body mass positively."
"The
presence of hotels also affected body mass positively ( p(≠0)
=0.91; Table 2)."
"Additional parameter estimates are pro-
vided in Appendix S1, Tables S3(integrated model), S4
(counts) and S5(body mass).
"
"Discussion
We used an integrated model that leveraged spatially limited
CMR data to estimate coconut crab subpopulation densitiesand sizes across 29 sites in and near the Pemba archipelago,
many of which only had very sparse survey data."
"The result-
ing total metapopulation estimate suggests that the Pembaarchipelago still sustains an important population of this
species.
"
"In the most westerly part of their range, coconut crabs
have been mostly extirpated along continental coastlines
from Somalia to Mozambique."
"Recent surveys of the Sey-
chelles archipelago report that coconut crabs are rare(reviewed in Cumberlidge et al.,2022 ; Poupin et al.,2013 );
populations on the four main Comoro Islands have suffered
rapid population declines of at least 50% over the past
15–20 years."
"Similarly, coconut crab populations on the
Glorieuses Islands have declined by 80% over the past
15–20 years and, if present at all, are found only in very
low numbers on military bases (Poupin et al.,2013 )."
"In the
Mozambique Channel, coconut crabs are extremely rare on
Juan de Nova Island and probably extirpated on Europa
Island (Poupin et al .,2013 )."
"Coconut crabs are presumed
exterminated from Madagascar based on exhaustive surveys.
"
"The species has also been eliminated from Mauritius (where
it was reported to be declining by Charles Darwin in 1836)and it is absent from Reunion and Rodrigues (see Cumber-lidge et al .,2022 for details)."
"Nonetheless, the species still
survives on Zanzibar (Caro et al.,2021 ).
"
"Two small islands off the coast of Zanzibar are formally
protected and renowned for their large coconut crab popula-
tions: Misali Island off the west coast of Pemba, and
Chumbe Island off the south-west coast of Unguja (Fig. 1).
"
"Misali is largely undisturbed except for two temporary ﬁsher-
men ’s camps, and currently has no hotels or villages; the
Chumbe ecolodge, where crabs routinely feed on kitchenscraps, is known to sustain a high-density population."
"Atleast ﬁve previous studies across 14 years have been con-
ducted on Misali, with population estimates ranging from 93
(Kassim, 2018 ) to 390 individuals (Merritt, 2014 ), with addi-
tional estimates of 239 (Harlan, 2014 ) and 157 (Klein & St.
Denis, 2016 )."
"These numbers might indicate population

 ﬂuctuations over time, which is also suggested —for Misali
and other CMR sites —by the considerable variation in
survey-speci ﬁc abundance estimates (Appendix S1,
Table S6)."
"However, abundance estimates from these previ-
ous studies are challenging to compare to our estimate of214 individuals as they refer to unde ﬁned and likely varying
sampled areas, as well as different amounts of time spent in
theﬁeld."
"In the context of the Pemba archipelago, Misali
harbours a considerable subpopulation of >200 individuals,
with much larger subpopulations only occurring at sites
which are c. 10 times greater in area (e.g. Fundo, Matumbini
KP, Table 1).
"
"Studies of coconut crabs on Chumbe have centred on the
ecolodge, which attracts individuals, and extrapolation oflodge density to the entire island generates in ﬂated abun-
dance estimates: 1849 (Singh, 2010 ), 1761 (Roop, 2004 ),
>1000 (Bruggers, 1999 ) and 354 (King, 2003 )."
"Even com-
pared to Kilstromer & Bergwall ( 2013 ), who sampled across
the island and estimated a population of 446 crabs, our
island-wide estimate of 214 individuals is low."
"Our abun-
dance estimate for the lodge area of 158 crabs (derived bymultiplying lodge area density from the integrated model
with the sampled area) is lower than the 291 individuals cap-
tured by Kilstromer & Bergwall ( 2013 ) in that area."
"But it is
premature to attribute this to a declining population, rather
than population ﬂuctuations."
"For example, rangers on
Chumbe report some seasonal ﬂuctuations in crabs appearing
at night around the kitchen area."
"Further, we could beunderestimating the number of crabs in the northern and
southern areas of the island, which is based on previously
reported capture proportions (see Methods)."
"Finally, our low
estimates may in part be due to the choice of a 100-m bufferto de ﬁne the sampled area, leading to a conservative density
estimate.
"
"Density in the Chumbe lodge area (42 crabs/ha), an area
of provisioning, matched Christmas Island, Australia, with itshigh density of 16.3 –47.3 crabs/ha (Drew & Hansson, 2014 ).
"
"With few exceptions, densities across subpopulations were
<5 crabs/ha and thus much lower than on Aldabra, a pro-
tected island in the Seychelles, with an estimated average
density of 23.7 crabs/ha (Appoo et al .,2021 )."
"Accordingly,
none of the Zanzibari sites, nor the entire Pemba archipel-ago, came close in population size to those reported for
Christmas Island, with 1.257 million coconut crabs (Schil-
ler,1988 ), or Eastern Indian Ocean sites of Morotai Island
and Saja ﬁIsland in the Malaku Islands, Indonesia with
20 163 and 43 434 individuals respectively (Widiyanti, Mar-
soedi, & Setyohadi, 2016 ; Serosero et al.,
2021 ).
"
"Body mass, densities and raw counts of coconut crabs at
sites lacking formal protection were lower than on the four
protected sites principally because no people other than
rangers live permanently on those islands (see also Caroet al.,2021 )."
"For density and body mass, informal protection
offered by private hotels had similarly positive effects."

 size (Sato & Suzuki, 2010 ), so these results suggest that pro-
tection not only increases population density but also poten-
tial reproductive output."
"While the degree of connectivity
among subpopulations through larval dispersal is unknown,this could point to protected subpopulations potentially serv-
ing as sources for the metapopulation."
"In contrast to ﬁndings
from an earlier study (Caro et al.,2021 ), however, we found
negative effects of agriculture on crab densities and counts."
"This suggests that food supplements provided by local agri-
culture may not be important as formerly suggested or that
their positive effects are counteracted by agriculture reducingthe area of native coral rag forest where coconut crabs live.
"
"Also, against our expectations, the overnight presence of
ﬁshermen was positively related to density (and, weakly,
counts)"
"but we expect this is an artefact of small
sample size.
"
"Our data suggest the importance of government protection
from exploitation and habitat encroachment."
"Consequently,
there is an urgent need to give more formal protection to
additional islands in the Zanzibari archipelago under the aus-pices of the Departments of Forestry and Fisheries responsi-ble for conservation of biological resources on Zanzibar.
"
"Tourist lodges may bolster local crab densities by providing
supplemental food resources (e.g. human food scraps) andhalting hunting pressure due to non-consumptive values of
tourists in the area."
"Whether this counters negative effects on
population size due to habitat loss involved in hotel con-struction should be assessed in the future.
"
"We derived an estimate of c. 6700 adult coconut crabs liv-
ing on the Pemba archipelago."
"Although this ﬁgure does not
match Indonesian sites of between 20 000 and 43 000 indi-
viduals, it still represents a substantial population in the
Western Indian Ocean."
"In spite of its protection status, Misalihas been leased for hotel development which is a great con-cern for this and other species inhabiting coral rag habitat.
"
"Other sites with large population sizes (e.g. Matumbini KP,
Fundo, Ngao and Kokota) are also being leased for invest-ment (Hamad et al .,2023 ) which involves removing large
areas of native vegetation for hotel construction, and an
inﬂux of people."
"We are hopeful that this metapopulation
estimate, unusual for an invertebrate (Caro, 2022 ), can be
used by departmental of ﬁcials charged with conservation of
Zanzibari wildlife to actively limit development of islandsites and establish additional protected sites for this andother coral rag species.
"
"Caveats
"
"In addition to the assumptions described in the Methods sec-
tion"
", our analysis also made strong assumptions about detec-
tion probability, movement and densities of coconut crabs."
"First, we used average detectability of crabs from ﬁve sites
to inform detectability at sites without CMR surveys."
"Detec-
tion parameters varied among the ﬁve sites with CMR esti-
mates."
"Using the same mean parameters for all non-CMRsites may in ﬂate differences in density estimates among sites.
"
"Still, in the absence of data suitable for estimating site-
speciﬁc parameters, average parameters from sites sampledwith the same ﬁeld methods represents the best available
information."
"Second, our decision to buffer all sampled areas
by 100 m implies that crab movements are comparable
across all sites."
This may be violated if differences in eco-logical conditions across sites affect crab movements.
"Again,
absence of site-speci ﬁc movement information (and sparsity
of movement information in general) precluded morenuanced buffering."
"In general, a more robust approach todensity estimation, in which density does not depend on a
subjectively chosen buffer, is preferable spatial capture –
recapture modelling (SCR, Royle et al.,2015 )."
"The approach
also allows animal movement onto and off the search area, a
violation of the geographic closure assumption in conven-
tional CMR that was likely present at some sites."
"Thisrequires recording spatial survey effort and capture locations
of individuals and was not feasible in this study, but should
be considered for future surveys."
"Models integrating SCRand other data types have been developed (e.g. Chandler &
Clark, 2014 ) and could be adapted if SCR data can only be
collected at a subset of sites."
"Thirdly, for some sites, the areato which we extrapolated population size was much largerthan the sampled area."
"This entails the untested assumption
that density is constant across large areas which almost cer-
tainly vary in their ecological conditions."
"Spatially replicatedsampling on Misali suggests that there can be considerable
variation in density even within a relatively small island
(Appendix S1, Table S7)."
"Therefore, ideally, these large areas
should be further subsampled, and/or future sampling effort
should be distributed across the archipelago so that ecologi-
cal gradients potentially important for coconut crabs (e.g.nearby agriculture, distance from human settlements, etc.) are
well represented and relationships between ecological condi-
tions and density can be estimated.
"
"Metapopulation survey
recommendations
While integrating information from data-rich and data-poor
sites allowed estimation of abundance for the latter, these
estimates come with high uncertainty, which, in turn, affects
uncertainty of the metapopulation estimate."
"Several of thedata-poor subpopulations in this study had extremely few
(and possibly no) crabs, and repeated visits to such unpro-
ductive sites, especially when remote, may be hard to justify."
"At the same time, the return on investment –in terms of
gains in precision with increased effort –declines at high
effort (Appendix S1, Figure S1).
"
"How to allocate limited effort across subpopulations
depends on project objectives."
"If the goal is to determine the
extent and size of a metapopulation, all potentially occupied
sites need surveying."
"A similar argument applies to monitor-ing over time if the goal is to understand extinction/colonisa-
tion dynamics which will probably occur in small
subpopulations."
"In that case, allocating more than a singlevisit to all sites to improve precision is advisable."
"If the
objective is enumerating/monitoring the bulk of individuals,
unproductive sites could be dropped and effort better distrib-uted equitably among remaining subpopulations."
"In this case,

 data imbalance among sites was extreme, and some degree
of standardization of sampling across the metapopulation is
likely advisable."
"Additionally, even single visit surveys could
be made more useful if additional information on detectabil-ity was collected (e.g. using double observer sampling;
Royle, 2004b )."
"Principles of large-scale monitoring designs
that balance spatial extent and temporal replication (e.g.panel designs in which some locations are visited every year,whereas others are visited at longer time intervals; Urquhart
& Kincaid ( 1999 )) could be used to determine optimal sam-
pling strategies for a speci ﬁc study objective.
"
"Broader signiﬁcance
Our study shows how relatively meagre subpopulation data
can be used to estimate the size of highly fragmented popu-
lations, something often dismissed as being too dif ﬁcult in
conservation science studies."
"Nevertheless, the behaviour ofpopulations in fragmented habitats is central to conservationscience and practice (Fahrig, 2003 ; Haddad et al .,2015 )."
"It
is seen in the context of piecemeal habitat destruction which
occurs during the advance of small-scale agriculture intopristine habitat, land division caused by road networks,
urban sprawl into rangeland and poorly planned habitat res-
toration projects."
"Fragmentation also bedevils populations innature reserves isolated from each other by agriculture, and
in natural populations living in isolated lakes, mountain top
habitats, or island archipelagos."
"Irrespective of whether thesefragmented populations are connected or not, our ability to
estimate their sizes across these landscapes will make conser-
vation plans better informed and relevant.

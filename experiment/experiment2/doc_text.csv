Seafood mislabelling and species substitution, compounded by a convoluted seafood supply chain 
with significant traceability challenges, hinder efforts towards more sustainable, responsible, 
and ethical fishing and business practices."
"We conducted the largest evaluation of the quality and 
accuracy of labels for 672 seafood products sold in Australia, assessing six seafood groups (i.e., hoki, 
prawns, sharks and rays, snapper, squid and cuttlefish, and tuna) from fishmongers, restaurants, 
and supermarkets, including domestically caught and imported products."
"DNA barcoding revealed 
11.8% of seafood tested did not match their label with sharks and rays, and snappers, having the 
highest mislabelling rate."
"Moreover, only 25.5% of products were labelled at a species‑level, while 
most labels used vague common names or umbrella terms such as ‘flake’ and ‘snapper’."
"These poor ‑
quality labels had higher rates of mislabelling than species‑specific labels and concealed the sale of 
threatened or overfished taxa, as well as products with lower nutritional quality, reduced economic 
value, or potential health risks."
"Our results highlight Australia’s weak seafood labelling regulations 
and ambiguous non‑mandatory naming conventions, which impede consumer choice for accurately 
represented, sustainable, and responsibly sourced seafood."
"We recommend strengthening labelling 
regulations to mitigate seafood mislabelling and substitution, ultimately improving consumer 
confidence when purchasing seafood.
"
"Global capture fisheries are essential for their contribution to nutrition, food security, and  livelihoods1,2."
"Seafood 
contributes heavily to national economies and is one of the most highly traded foods globally, accounting for 11% 
of the total agricultural trade (excluding forestry) by  value3."
"Y et, the sustainability of fisheries resources has con-
tinued to decline globally since the  1970s4,5, with almost half of assessed fish stocks overfished and nearly 1 in 10 
stocks at the brink of  collapse4–6."
"Sustainable fisheries management has focused mostly on fishers and  regulators7. 
"
"However, improvements in the seafood supply chain, market-based measures, and consumer influence can posi-
tively contribute towards more sustainable, responsible, and ethical fishing and business  practices8–11.
"
"The seafood supply chain is complex and convoluted, making tracing products from point of harvest through 
to processing, distribution, and onto the end market a significant  challenge12,13."
"The seafood industry is not 
required to meet the same standards as other commonly consumed products, such as milk and eggs, which have 
traceability measures in place with mandatory identification and reporting of its country of origin, ingredients, 
and a unique code, among  others14."
"As a result, weak seafood labelling and import regulations create opportuni-
ties for substitution of products and can increase the risk of mislabelling and  fraud12,15,16."
"This hampers consumer 
choices for sustainability, undermines sustainable fisheries management by providing an avenue for illegal, 
unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing products to enter legitimate markets, can cause economic loss to 
governments, and could pose a number of public health and food safety  concerns9,16–20.
"
"The seafood sector is one of the major food sectors vulnerable to fraudulent  activities12,15,17,20."
"Species substi-
tution and seafood mislabelling are the most common forms of seafood fraud and can occur at multiple points 
in the global supply  "
"chain15,20. Substitution is predominantly driven by price incentives when a species of lesser 
value and quality are swapped and sold as more expensive and/or desirable  species21."
"It can also occur when a 
species is marketed as a different product to conceal its origin of harvest if caught in an area closed to fishing, to OPEN

www.nature.com/scientificreports/hide that it was illegally harvested, or to avoid regulation, tariffs, and  taxation11,12,15,20,21."
"Mislabelling and substitu-
tion could also be driven by a lack of constant supply of a depleting fishery resource to meet market demand and 
mislead the consumer by concealing the sale of overfished  species16,22,23."
"Unintentional mislabelling of seafood 
is also common, often due to mixed fisheries with similar species being confused and misidentified, or due to 
weak seafood labelling regulations and ambiguous fish naming  standards11,12,21.
"
"There is strong interest from Australian seafood consumers for clear and reliable labelling of seafood products 
(i.e., including the species identity, country of origin and production method)18,24."
"For example, a recent survey 
by the Marine Stewardship Council found that 9 in 10 Australian seafood consumers want better information 
on labels to help make sustainable seafood  purchases24."
"However, Australia lacks strong labelling regulations and 
enforcement of standard naming conventions, undermining Australia’s strong fisheries governance framework 
and robust efforts to prevent overfishing and achieve critical biodiversity  targets25."
"Whilst there are standards 
and regulations in place (i.e., the Australia New Zealand Food Standards  Code14 and the Country of Origin Food 
Labelling Information  Standard26) these are not comprehensive."
"For example, seafood labelling regulations do 
not require detailed information on the identity of the species or other key details to trace products from end-
to-end, including species scientific name and fishing or farming  method23,27."
"Moreover, reporting the country of 
origin is only required for fresh or frozen seafood sold in Australia, but not for cooked products (except in the 
Northern Territory)."
"This is concerning given that two thirds of the seafood consumed in Australia is  imported27, 
and many of the source countries that Australia imports its seafood from have lower standards of fishing practices 
or have documented instances of poor fisheries governance and labour  practices6,28,29.
"
"Naming conventions used for the trade of seafood globally, and on market labels in Australia, are ambiguous, 
generic, outdated or missing taxa, and often lack the taxonomic resolution required to identify fish to a species 
 level9,15,30."
"The Australian Fish Names Standard AS 5300-2019 (herein AFNS) is a non-mandatory fish naming 
standard for over 5,000 domestic finfish and an additional 600 commercially important domestic and imported 
fish species, and allows for the grouping of multiple species with diverse biological traits and geographical 
origins under single generic ‘umbrella’ labels (e.g., ‘flake’ or ‘snapper’)."
"The AFNS is a voluntary standard with 
no legal obligation to be enforced (except for the export of Australian seafood products)."
"As a result, different 
commercial or market names continue to be used for a single species and umbrella terms are misused, extending 
the number of species referred to under these  labels31."
"This compromises the integrity of the seafood market by 
creating numerous pathways for products to be mislabelled or substituted."
"Consequently, Australian seafood 
consumers lack sufficient detail on the seafood products they consume impeding their ability to make informed 
purchasing decisions.
"
"In more recent years, key seafood markets in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) have 
adopted comprehensive legislative frameworks and stringent labelling regulations to ensure seafood traceability 
and prohibit the importation of threatened or IUU caught species."
"For example, in 2014 the EU implemented 
requirements under Regulation (EU) 1379/2013 for seafood labels to report scientific names, harvest or produc-
tion method, area of catch (i.e., FAO area, sub-area or division), country of origin, and fishing gear used, among 
 others32."
"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a Seafood List outlining acceptable common 
names, market names, and scientific names that are mandated when commercially  traded33."
"Additionally, the 
US FDA adopted DNA based methods for regulatory use to authenticate fish products and monitor seafood 
mislabelling, ensuring compliance in the seafood market and food  safety34.
"
"Monitoring the integrity of the seafood market and identifying seafood mislabelling is challenging given that 
most products are sold already processed for consumption, meaning that morphological features used for spe -
cies identification are  removed15."
"In the absence of morphological identification, DNA barcoding methods are 
commonly used to accurately and reliably verify the authenticity of seafood and their labels via the sequencing of 
species-specific gene regions, i.e., a species’ DNA  barcode35–38."
"There has been extensive effort to quantify seafood 
mislabelling, with global rates at the product level estimated between 8 and 25% on  average16,20."
"However, some 
seafood groups are reported to have especially high rates of mislabelling and sampling efforts are highly skewed 
towards certain taxa and  geographies16,17,20,39."
"For example, efforts to evaluate mislabelling are higher in the US, 
Italy, and Spain, and some of the most common family groups sampled in mislabelling studies include: cods and 
haddocks; mackerels, tunas and bonitos; sharks; and  salmonids16,31,40."
"Consequently, the extent of mislabelling 
remains largely unknown for many taxa and countries.
"
"In Australia, there are few studies assessing seafood mislabelling, but these are limited in scope and 
 capacity9,30,31,41."
"A study in Tasmania in 2015 assessed 38 seafood samples and while no mislabelling was detected, 
it recognised naming discrepancies and ambiguity that may cause confusion to  consumers30."
"Similarly, a study 
based in Sydney in 2019 assessed 68 samples and found only 7% were mislabelled, but 40% of fish names used in 
the labels did not comply with AFNS  recommendations41."
"Cawthorn et al. reported 16% of snapper products sold 
in two states in Australia (32 samples) were  mislabelled9."
"And recently, Sharrad et al. reported seafood mislabel-
ling rates for shark products sold in 104 retailers in South Australia, where only 11% of samples were correctly 
identified, 20% had instances of mislabelling, and the remaining products were ambiguously  labelled31."
"While 
these studies align with international findings that indicate instances of  mislabelling40,42, there has not been a 
country-wide assessment of mislabelling across seafood products sold in Australia.
"
"To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted this study that presents the largest effort to date to assess the quality 
of seafood labelling and rates of seafood mislabelling in Australia."
"We assessed 672 seafood samples across 6 
groups (i.e., hoki, prawns, sharks and rays, snapper, squid and cuttlefish, and tuna), including nationally caught 
(herein domestic) and imported seafood products sold in Australia."
"Seafood was purchased at the consumer-
end from fishmongers (i.e., a market-style retailer that specifically sells fish), restaurants, and supermarkets 
across seven of the eight Australian states and territories."
"Specifically, we addressed three questions: (1) What is 
the level of taxonomic specificity of seafood labels?"
"(2) Are seafood vendors adopting labels that align with the  3

"and, (3) what are the mislabelling rates of seafood sold in Australia and how do these vary across seafood 
products, origin, and outlet type?

Label specificity."
"Label specificity was assessed for all 672 seafood samples collected across Australia (Sup-
plementary Table S2)."
"A quarter of the samples were described in the label at the species level (25.5%) and more 
than half were described at the family or higher taxonomic level (17.6% and 38.2%, respectively; Fig.  1a), while 
the remaining 18.8% were labelled at genus level."
"The averaged ordinal GAM fitted on label specificity included 
the terms in order of the normalized sum of weights, sustainability certification (1.0), outlet type (1.0), pack-
aging (1.0), seafood group (1.0), Australian state of purchase (1.0), wild caught or aquaculture sourced (0.95, 
fresh or frozen (0.77), origin (0.52), price per kilogram (0.28)."
"The four models included in the average had an 
explained deviance ranging between 33.7 and 34.1%.
"
"Label specificity differed significantly between some seafood groups with squid and cuttlefish being the 
most likely to be labelled less specifically than all other seafood groups relative to the intercept (Est = 4.65, Std 
Err = 0.38, p =  < 0.001; Fig.  1b; Supplementary Table S4); 80.5% of the squid and cuttlefish samples were labelled at 
a taxonomic level higher than family."
"Similarly, the majority of snapper, and shark and ray samples were labelled 
at a taxonomic level higher than family (57.1% and 79.4%, respectively) and nearly two thirds of prawn samples 
(59.5%) were labelled at the family level."
"The seafood groups with the most specific labelling of its products were 
tuna and hoki, with more than half (56.6%) of tuna products labelled at species level, and almost all (92.5%) of 
the hoki products labelled at either species or genus level."
"There was no statistical difference between specificity 
for tuna and hoki determined from the ordinal GAM (p = 0.07), both as likely as the other to be labelled at a 
higher specificity than the other four seafood groups (Supplementary Table S4).

"www.nature.com/scientificreports/Whilst seafood origin added to the explanatory power of the model based on AIC and thus was included in 
the final averaged GAM, the estimate for the term was not statistically significant (Est = − 0.19, Std Err = 0.25, 
p = 0.46)."
"Imported products had a bimodal distribution when classified across specificity levels, suggesting that 
while many products enter the country with species-specific information, many imported seafood products 
lack taxonomic resolution (Fig.  1c)."
"Products from supermarkets had the most specific labels of the outlet types 
sampled with nearly half of products labelled at the species level (45.4%)."
"While most products from restaurants 
(58.8%) and nearly half of products from fishmongers (40.8%) were labelled at a taxonomic level higher than 
family (Fig.  1d)."
"The specificity of labels from each of the three outlet types were found by the ordinal GAM to 
be significantly different from each other."
"Products from supermarkets were predicted to have a higher likeli-
hood of being labelled more specifically than products from a fishmonger (Est = − 0.80, Std."
"Err = 0.26, p < 0.01), 
whilst restaurants were more likely to be labelled at a lower specificity than a fishmonger product (Est = 1.31, 
Std."
"Err  = 0.25, p < 0.001)"
"(Supplementary Table S4).
"
Misnaming.
"Overall, 15.9% of the samples in our study were misnamed."
"It is important to note that this does 
not imply the names do not correspond to the species sold, but instead that the label does not use the official 
nomenclature given in the AFNS."
"The seafood groups with the highest rates of misnaming were: squid and cut-
tlefish (32.8%) driven by labels commonly using the term ‘calamari’ that is not recognised on its own by AFNS, 
snapper (25%) driven by the use of terms such as ‘red snapper’ or ‘pink snapper’ , and sharks and rays (20.6%) 
driven by the use of the undescriptive term ‘shark’ that is not included in AFNS.
"
Seafood mislabelling rates.
"We were able to evaluate mislabelling for 587 products out of the 672 original 
samples."
"There were 66 samples removed due to unsuccessful COI barcode amplification, low quality sequence 
chromatograms, no significant hits in the BOLD and NCBI databases, or only low confidence in hits (where the 
hit represented the single entry for that species in the sequence database)."
"The 606 sequences retrieved were 
all > 98% similarity to reference species available in the BOLD and NCBI databases."
"A further 19 samples were 
removed due to suspected contamination, because the sample was derived from a mixed animal product and 
the significant sequence hits were to other animals known to be within the product (e.g., pig from a pork and 
prawn dumpling).
"
"The overall extent of seafood mislabelling at the consumer end in Australia was estimated at 11.8% with 
labels from 69 products out of 587 samples not matching the species identified in the DNA analysis (Fig.  2). 
"
"Mislabelling rates varied across levels of label specificity, only 5.0% of samples at a species level were mislabelled, 
while a greater extent of mislabelling (21.7%) occurred in samples labelled at higher taxonomic level than family 
(Table  1)."
"While mislabelling was assessed from maximum level of detail in writing only, verbal validation by 
the vendor was prompted, when possible."
"However, of the 139 sequenced products that had vendor validation, 
nearly half (45.3%) were proven to be incorrect identifications of the product."
"In 4 instances only, the vendor 
information reverted a product from mislabelled to correct.
"
"The seafood group with the highest rate of mislabelling were sharks and rays (35.9%, Figs.  2 and 3 ) followed 
by snappers (25.2%, Figs.  2 and 4 ) then the squid and cuttlefish (12.7%; Fig.  2)."

"Error bars represent Wald-type 95% 
confidence intervals."
"Note that labels included common names and umbrella terms at taxonomic levels higher 
than species, thus mislabelling occurred when the species identified using DNA barcoding was not within the 
group of species inferred by the label."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/labelled correctly more often than the other three seafood groups, with mislabelling rates at 4.2%, 2.0%, and 1.0%, 
respectively (Fig.  2)."
"Hoki only had a single case of mislabelling that occurred in a sample labelled at species level. 
"
"Snapper and sharks and rays had high mislabelling rates in samples labelled least specifically, 34.4% and 39.7% 
respectively, that is at the taxonomic level higher than family (Supplementary Table S3).
"
Sensitivity analysis of label‑to‑species definitions.
"Mislabelling rates varied greatly depending on the label-to-
species definition used (see Methods section for details and examples of the definitions used in this study)."
"Had 
the stricter AFNS definitions of common and umbrella terms been used, rates of mislabelling would have been 
almost three times higher (34.9%) than those from the more comprehensive definitions used in this study."
"This 
change would have important impacts across all seafood groups (Table  2)."
"While the ranking of mislabelling 
per seafood group remains the same, the AFNS label-to-species definitions would increase rates for all seafood 
groups."
"For example, the mislabelling rate for prawns would increase nearly sixfold from 2.0 to 11.9%, and rates 
for squid and cuttlefish, snapper, and sharks and rays would be 40.7%, 56.1% and 78.3%, respectively."
"Similarly, 
using the stricter AFNS definition only for products labelled as ‘flake’ , with all other definitions remaining as 
defined in this study, we would see an increase from 11.8 to 16.7% in the overall mislabelling rate, and from 
37.0% to 67.4% when only considering the samples in the shark and rays group."
"Conversely, if the definition of 
‘flake’ was more lenient by including holocephalans, the overall mislabelling rate would decrease to 9.4% overall 
and it would nearly halve to 20.7% for shark and ray samples.
"
Drivers of mislabelling.  
"The averaged survival analysis fitted on mislabelling with respect to specificity included 
the terms (in order of sum of weights): outlet type (1.0), seafood group (1.0), Australian state of purchase (1.0), 
price per kilogram (0.81), origin (0.80), wild caught or aquaculture sourced (0.49), sustainability certification 
(0.24), fresh or frozen (0.16).
"
"The model-averaged fit for the survival analysis found significant differences (p  < 0.05) in mislabelling rates 
between seafood groups where hoki, prawn, and tuna had all significantly lower rates than snapper and sharks 
and rays."
"Squid and cuttlefish had statistically higher rates of mislabelling than hoki (Est = − 1.1, Std Err  = 0.50, 
p = 0.03), but statistically lower rates than both snapper (Est = − 1.95, Std Err = 0.45, p =  < 0.0001), and shark and 
rays with the latter found to have the highest rates of mislabelling across the seafood groups sampled (Est = − 2.25, 
Std Err = 0.45, p =  < 0.0001) (Supplementary Table S5).
"
"There were more instances of mislabelling in imported products (14.6%) than in those of domestic origin 
(9.2%; Table  1) and, while the AIC model selection process indicates that seafood origin is important in explain-
ing mislabelling, the term for seafood origin was not statistically significant at the p = 0.05 level (Est = 2.3, Std 
Err = 0.17, p  = 0.17)."
"Mislabelling rates varied among different outlet types with fishmongers having a mislabel -
ling rate of 11.3%, this level acted as the intercept for the survival analysis."
"Restaurants had the highest rates at 
18.8%, differing significantly from fishmongers (Est  = − 0.66, Std Err = 0.18, p < 0.001), while supermarkets had 
the lowest rate at 4.6% but were not significantly different from fishmongers (Est = 0.34, Std Err = 0.19, p = 0.06). 
"
"In particular, the highest rates of mislabelling (28.0%) were found at restaurants in products labelled at a higher 
taxonomic level than family, although we found no additional effect of an interaction upon exploration (Sup -
plementary Table S5).
"
Standardising seafood mislabelling rates.  
"Predicting mislabelling rates, assuming all products had been assessed 
at the species level, we estimated a mislabelling rate of 24.5% overall (95% CI, 19.2–83.3), in comparison with 
an empirical observation of 11.8% without controlling for censoring (Fig.  5a)."
"By seafood group, sharks and 
rays had the largest increase in predicted mislabelling when controlling for censoring, with rates doubling to 
80.4% (95% CI, 69.6–98.9) if assessed at species level."
"Similarly, the mislabelling rate for snapper is expected to 
increase to 54.2% (95% CI, 37.4–98.1), while mislabelling rates for squid and cuttlefish, as well as tuna products, 
were predicted to increase to 5.3% (95% CI, 2.7–76.1) and 4.2% (95% CI, 4.2–52.8) respectively if assessed at 
the species level."
"Hoki and prawns, however, were not predicted to have different mislabelling rates if specific-
ity was standardised to species level and remained at 1.0% (95% CI, 1.0–100.0) and 2.0% (95% CI, 2.0–66.3), 
respectively (Fig. "

increase relative to the censored results from 4.6 to 5.1% (95% CI, 4.6–73.1) (Fig.  5d).
"
"Discussion
Seafood label quality and mislabelling rates hamper consumer choices for sustainability in Australia due to poor 
taxonomic resolution, the use of ambiguous umbrella terms and product substitution or misidentification."
"In 
the largest evaluation of the quality and accuracy of seafood labels in Australia, we observed that over 1 in 10 
seafood products tested did not match their label, and close to three quarters of seafood labels assessed lacked 
sufficient taxonomic detail for consumers to be informed of what species they are purchasing."
"We identified that 
products sold under poor-quality labels, using vague common names or umbrella terms, have higher rates of 
mislabelling than species-specific labels."
"For instance, we identified 21.7% mislabelling in products labelled at 
taxonomic level higher than family, while only 5.0% for products labelled to species level."
"Our findings align with 
prior studies, revealing significant differences in label quality and mislabelling rates among seafood  groups16,17 
and outlet  types37,43,44."
"Sharks and rays, and snappers, were the seafood groups that had the highest incidence of 
mislabelling."
"And products sold in restaurants had less specific labels and higher mislabelling rates than seafood 
sold at fishmongers or supermarkets.
"
The reported mislabelling rate of 11.8% is likely a conservative estimate.
"Had stricter label-to-species defi-
nitions as per AFNS been applied here, 34.9% of seafood products would have been considered mislabelled. 
"
"However, for the purpose of this study, a more comprehensive definition was preferred given that AFNS are 
not currently mandatory or enforced."
"Current lenient seafood labelling regulations and vague naming conven-
tions facilitate the use of generic names that group multiple species from different taxonomic groups or with 
diverse biological traits under umbrella terms, ultimately increasing the risk of mislabelled or incorrectly named 
products being sold to  consumers9,45."
"This is shown in our results as products with species-level identification of 
the product available in writing to the consumer were less likely to be mislabelled."
"For example, market names 
for shark and ray products consistently used ambiguous and often misleading umbrella terms such as ‘flake’ 
and ‘shark’ , which could refer to 326 unique species under our comprehensive  definition46–50—only 5 of the 97 
products sampled had labels at a species-specific level."
"The use of generic umbrella terms for the sale of shark 
products to the consumer has been shown to ultimately conceal and misrepresent the identity of the species sold.
"
"Shark and ray products had the highest occurrence of mislabelling of the seafood groups assessed (35.9%). 
"
"The DNA barcoding analyses revealed that in 18 instances products incorrectly labelled as ‘flake’ , or to a lesser 
extent as ‘shark’ , were in fact holocephalans (i.e., Chimaeras) such as Callorhinchus capensis, Callorhinchus milii,  
and Callorhinchus callorhinchus  (Fig.  3)."
"The high mislabelling rates in shark products found in this study align 
with previous findings e.g., 20% mislabelled in  Australia31, or 45% mislabelled in  Italy40, or 55% mislabelled in 
 Brazil42."
"This is of concern as one third of chondrichthyan species are listed on the IUCN Red List as  threatened51. 
"
"Consumers would not be able to confidently identify when they are purchasing a sustainable product or a 
threatened species."
"For example, our study recorded two mislabelling cases for Critically Endangered species 
on the IUCN Red  List52,53, these were a spotback skate (Atlantoraja castelnaui ) mislabelled as ‘stingray’ , and a 
school shark ( Galeorhinus galeus) mislabelled as a ‘gummy shark’—the latter potentially misidentified given 
these two species are caught in the same  fishery52."
"Similarly, pigeye shark ( Carcharhinus amboinensis ), listed as 
 Vulnerable54, was sold under the label of ‘flake’ , as well as, mislabelled as ‘black tip shark’ ."
"Concealed under the 
label ‘shark’ , we identified the sale of 5 taxa that are threatened or of conservation concern including a sandbar 
shark ( Carcharhinus plumbeus ) listed as  Endangered55, and a smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena) which may 
become threatened with extinction without close control of its trade according to Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and is listed as  Vulnerable56."
"See Table S7 in 
Supplementary Materials for a full list of species matched to samples and their IUCN listing.
"
"In Australia, shark meat is a popular seafood often sold under the term ‘flake’ , which represented 51.5% of 
our shark and ray samples."
"As defined in this study, flake is a catch-all consumer-facing market name used to Table 2.  "
Mislabelling rates under different labeling leniencies.
"As per the AFNS definition, strict flake is 
defined as only referring to the species, Mustelus antarcticus  and Mustelus lenticulatus ."
"Lenient flake definition 
includes all selachimorphs (sharks) and holocephalans (chimaeras) –, Infers no change to the mislabelling rate 
of that seafood group."

"However, according to the AFNS, ‘flake’ is the approved term only for the flesh of gummy 
shark ( Mustelus antarcticus ) and the New Zealand rig shark ( Mustelus lenticulatus )—while this definition was 
approved in 2014, it has not been  enforced50."
"The use of this stricter flake definition in our study would have 
resulted in higher mislabelling rates overall (16.7%) and for the shark and ray group (67.4%)."
"Specific examples 
of species hidden within the term ‘flake’ included eight incidences of the Critically Endangered school shark 
(Galeorhinus galeus) and a broadnose sevengill shark ( Notorynchus cepedianus ), listed as Vulnerable (Fig.  4).
"
"Snapper products are also labelled using generic and ambiguous terms in Australia and were found to be most 
likely labelled at a taxonomic level higher than family."
"A ‘true’ snapper is generally considered to be from the 
Lutjanidae  family57, but the use of this market name varies across countries and  regions9."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/definition of the umbrella term ‘snapper’ was comprehensive and, for this study, included 123 unique species 
from 5 different families (i.e., Lutjanidae, Berycidae, Sparidae, Lethrinidae, and Cheilodactylidae)."
"Y et, snapper 
had the highest species diversity for mislabelled products, often substituted by species from family groups outside 
of what is considered a ‘snapper’ ."
"Some of the substitutions included tilapia (Oreochromis spp. ), which has some 
species listed on the IUCN Red List as  Vulnerable58, and barramundi ( Lates calcarifer ), a peculiar mislabelling 
occurrence given this product is generally of higher  price59 (Fig.  4)."
"The wide diversity of fish names that fall 
under this umbrella term is problematic for fisheries statistics and traceability given most snapper fisheries are 
data deficient and poorly managed, and the taxa combined vary considerably in vulnerability and sustainability 
of their  fisheries9,10.
"
"There were a number of products labelled as ‘snapper’ that were substituted at some point in the supply chain 
for lower quality or value species, such as black jewfish (Protonibea diacanthus ), goldsaddle goatfish (Parupeneus 
cyclostomus ), or parrotfish species (Scaridae spp.), suggesting economic incentives behind these substitutions 
(Fig.  4)."
Similar substitutions for lower value products were also detected in prawn and tuna products.
"For exam -
ple, a product labelled as ‘tiger prawn’ was identified as the lower value ‘vannamei prawn’ ( Penaeus vannamei ), 
and a tuna product labelled to species-level with ‘Katsuwonus pelamis’  on its packaging was genetically identified 
as Alaskan  pollock59."
"We also recorded some substitutions of high value products labelled as lower value species, 
which could indicate an intention to conceal regulatory or environmental concerns of the product being sold, a 
way to maintain perceived availability of a known product in case of supply issues, or simply an unintentional 
 misidentification16,21–23."
"Examples included products genetically identified as pink snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) 
that were labelled as products of lower quality or value, such as ‘red snapper’ and ‘saddletail snapper’ (Fig.  4). 
"
"Similarly, a tuna product labelled as a ‘skipjack tuna’ (Katsuwonus pelamis ) was substituted with a more valuable 
tuna (Thunnus spp.), this substitution adds potential health risks from inadvertent consumption of higher trophic 
level species with greater heavy metal  content12,60.
"
"In considering the label quality and accuracy of products from different outlet types, we found supermarket 
products to have the most specific labels and the lowest occurrence of mislabelling."
"Seafood from supermarkets 
is generally packaged, which can facilitate more detailed information, such as including species names in the 
ingredients section."
"This was especially apparent in tuna products, with most supermarket tuna products (88.9%) 
having species-specific common or scientific names provided on labels, for instance in tuna cans."
"Conversely, 
restaurants had the highest mislabelling rates and the lowest specificity of product labels, as most menus provided 
only family level information like ‘tuna sashimi’ or ‘tuna sushi roll’ ."
"Moreover, we found that verbal validation 
by seafood vendors, mostly possible at restaurants and fishmongers, should not be used as an alternative to 
written labelling."
"Vendor identification attempting to improve label specificity did not match our DNA analysis 
nearly half of the times (45.3%), and only in four instances the vendor validation would have shifted a product 
from being mislabelled to correct."
"Thus, reinforcing the need for more specific and accurate written  labels37,43,44.
"
"Given the high volume of imported seafood consumed in Australia, we assessed labelling of both domesti -
cally sourced and imported seafood products."
"Our results revealed labelling issues at the consumer-end across 
both origins as very few products, 22.9% of domestic and 28.0% of imported, had sufficient detail to identify 
the product at a species level."
"Mislabelling rates were higher for imported at 14.6% than for domestic seafood 
products at 9.2%."
"Therefore, the existing framework for seafood import control is insufficient and should capture 
more details at the  border27, and strengthening seafood labelling regulations in Australia, for both imported and 
domestic products, is necessary to improve labelling quality and accuracy at the consumer-end.
"
"DNA barcoding using the mitochondrial COI gene is an established method for species level identification of 
unknown samples and has proven to be a useful tool to identify seafood  mislabelling15,17,19,30,37,61."
"However, the 
marker may contain insufficient information to discern very closely related taxa, such as members of the genus 
Thunnus62,63."
"This limitation may have contributed to the lower mislabelling rate that we found in tuna products 
compared to other seafood groups in this study."
"Furthermore, DNA barcoding technology cannot determine the 
geographical origin of a fish species—which prevented confirmation of the origin reported in the label, nor the 
point in the supply chain where mislabelling or substitution occurred, or if it was deliberate or  accidental11,15. 
"
"This limitation to identify the stage and intent was further constrained in this study by only sampling products 
at the consumer end of the seafood supply chain, future efforts could assess mislabelling rates at various stages, 
including at the border for imported products.
"
"This study offers a novel perspective on seafood mislabelling assessments because we have included a broad 
range of seafood products sold to consumers, regardless of the level of specificity in the label, rather than limiting 
our sample to products labelled at species  level9,11,64."
"While this approach is a closer representation of the mis -
labelling experienced by seafood consumers in Australia, we are aware that measuring mislabelling at different 
levels of specificity could challenge comparison across studies."
"Therefore, we used a predictive model to control 
for censoring and estimate mislabelling rates as if all products were assessed at species level."
"Our findings reveal 
that seafood mislabelling in Australia is likely closer to 24.5%, which aligns more closely with the upper estimate 
of the global average range 8–25%16,20."
"Moreover, exploring mislabelling across diverse levels of label specificity 
showed that consumers target species-specific identification for some products, which may be a market feature 
(e.g., bluefin tuna that implies certain taste and texture), but demand less specificity for other products where 
the demand is for any species that meet certain features (e.g., firm mild-flavored white flesh, like flake).
"
"Overall, our results highlight the need for regulatory action to improve traceability in both the domestic and 
imported seafood supply chains."
"We recommend improvements to seafood labelling regulations that enforce the 
use of species-specific common and scientific names by establishing mandatory official fish naming standards 
that are comprehensive and harmonized among trading countries."
"Internationally, Harmonised System (HS) 
trade codes are already established international commodity codes that are implemented to better identify 
products throughout the supply  chain10."
"This system can increase traceability of products, for instance, tuna 
products already require HS codes and were found to be among the most specifically and accurately labelled  11
Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2023)"
"13:10146  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37066-4
www.nature.com/scientificreports/when compared to other seafood groups."
"However, HS trade codes have insufficient taxonomic granularity and 
could be improved by standardizing nomenclature at a genus and species level and be expanded to incorporate 
more species."
"On a national scale, we recommend a comprehensive review of the AFNS and their mandatory 
enforcement through stronger labelling regulations."
"If Australia was to adopt better labelling regulations, similar 
to other global markets such as the EU and US, consumers could be more confident that their seafood is sustain-
ably and legally caught, safe, and honestly labelled.
"
"Seafood mislabelling is prevalent in international seafood supply chains and our study confirms its extent 
and magnitude across seafood products sold in Australia."
"Specifically, we provide key baseline knowledge on the 
specificity and accuracy of seafood labels, highlighting the differences across seafood groups and outlet types. 
"
"Our conservative mislabelling rates in Australia (11.8%) fall within the global average estimates (8–25%16,20) and 
range from as low as 1.0% of hoki products mislabelled to as high as 35.9% of shark and ray products mislabelled. 
"
"Moreover, we shine a light on the most controversial umbrella terms that are used domestically (i.e., shark, flake, 
and snapper) and some of the implications hidden behind vague labelling (e.g., higher mislabelling rates and 
trade of endangered species, among others)65."
"We also deploy a novel statistical approach that allows fair com -
parison of mislabelling rates, even in the presence of differing taxonomic resolution among product labels."
"Our 
findings should inform policy changes to improve seafood labelling regulations in Australia, which in turn can 
positively impact fisheries regulation and management, both nationally and internationally, through increased 
demand for sustainable and traceable seafood products."
"As a result, consumers should be able to exercise their 
right to make informed choices and reduce the environmental, economic and health implications associated 
with ambiguous or inaccurate seafood labelling.
"
"Methods
Sample collection."
"A total of 672 domestic (n = 336) and imported (n = 336) seafood products were anony-
mously purchased between May and June 2022 from randomly selected outlets, based on the availability of the 
seafood of interest."
"Purchases from fishmongers (n = 196), restaurants (n = 238), and supermarkets (n = 238) 
were included."
"To ensure national representation, 96 seafood samples were collected from seven out of eight 
states and territories in Australia, namely New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, 
Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia."
"Samples were selected across six seafood groups that were identified 
as either significant species imported into the Australian seafood market or commonly consumed species in 
 Australia66,67."
"These included hoki (n = 106), prawns (n = 116), sharks and rays (n = 97), snapper (n = 112), squid 
and cuttlefish (n = 128), and tuna (n = 113)."
"The number of samples across location, seafood group, and outlet 
type were standardised but dependent on the availability of products in each state (Fig.  6)."
"Seafood products 
were only sampled once per outlet in each state, with the exception of 4 pairs of products where the same product 
was sampled twice."
"In these cases, the products were fresh and purchased at a minimum of 1 week apart and were 
therefore considered independent samples over time.
"
"To provide appropriate representation of the seafood consumed in Australia, the selected seafood products 
varied including wild caught fisheries, aquaculture farmed, processed (e.g., cooked, frozen, battered, marinated, 
smoked, peeled, or prepared in a meal) and unprocessed (i.e., raw, fresh), packaged in various forms (e.g., canned 
or bagged), and ranged from low-value ($3.43/kg) to high-value ($299.90/kg)."
"A summary of the price of sea -
food products sampled is available in Table S6 and the price of each sample (overall and price per kilogram) are 
included in the dataset associated with this publication (see data availability statement)."
"Photos of the seafood 
product and its associated labels, packaging, signage and/or menus were taken at the time of purchase to ensure 
traceability."
"In some cases the price per kilogram was unavailable (~ 5.5%), and in these instances we used the R 
mice package (v3.15.0) to impute the data using a predictive mean matching  technique68.
"
"Metadata on the product was collected from both the written information available on the label and, when 
possible, additional details on the product that were provided by the vendor, which were not used for the main 
assessment but added as additional information."
"The label information was available either in the packaging, 
signage, or menu and the following was recorded when available:
1."
"Main label  or product name.
"
"2. Maximum Level of Detail: the lowest taxonomic identification of the product available for the consumer in 
writing (i.e., without the need to ask for it)."
"This information may be available in the main label or anywhere 
else in the associated signs, packaging (e.g., ingredient list), menu or restaurant boards, as long as it is not 
necessary to ask vendors to access the additional information.
"
3.
"Vendor Validation : vendors were asked to identify the species of the seafood product if the label was ambigu -
ous (e.g., “market fish”)."
"This was not considered as label information but was recorded separately to assess 
how this information complements the written details available for the consumer.
"
4.
Origin : classification between domestic or imported products.
"Information on country of origin and country 
of packing and/or processing was also collected.
"
5.
"Product market data  such as price, price per kilogram, outlet type, third-party certifications (i.e., Marine 
Stewardship Council, MSC; or Aquaculture Stewardship Council, ASC), processing and packaging informa-

Tissue sampling.
"Muscle tissue pieces were excised from the seafood product on the same day as purchas-
ing and smeared onto individual Whatman Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) mini, non-indicating cards 
using sterile equipment as described in Rigby et al.69 to purify and preserve nucleic acids for storage at room 
 temperature70."
"Where possible, pieces of muscle tissue were taken from the inner section of the product to avoid 
contamination of DNA from other species that may be present on the external surface."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/of disagreeing bases, using the base with the higher quality score."
"The resulting consensus sequences were com-
pared with NCBI-NT76 and  BOLD77 sequence database (all Arthropoda and Chordata sequences, downloaded 
25th August 2022) using blastn (v2.13.0+)78 keeping 9,999,999 target sequences per query (–max_target_seqs 
9,999,999), filtering by hits with a query coverage of 98%, a base pair identity with BOLD and NCBI databases 
above 98%, a low e-value (–evalue 1e−10), and assuming distant species hits (-task blastn)."
"BOLD entries with 
imprecise taxon assignment above the species level (i.e., family- or order-level) were removed from blastn hits.
"
Both NCBI-NT and BOLD sequence databases contain misidentified or mislabelled entries.
"To avoid spuri -
ous identifications due to such sequence database curation issues, we did not consider matches where the total 
number of hits was less than 1% of the total entries for that species."
"We also removed any hits where there was 
only one blast hit per species in NCBI and BOLD databases to improve confidence in the species assignment. 
"
"Any hits at taxonomic levels higher than species-level were also omitted (e.g., “ Carcharhinus sp . ”"
"or “unidenti -
fied shark fin”).
"
Label specificity.
"Label specificity refers to the maximum level of taxonomic detail available in writing for 
consumers."
"All samples were classified based on their label specificity from most specific (i.e., highest precision) 
to least (i.e., lowest precision) under the following categories:
– Species level : label refers to a single species, including a scientific name and/or a common name that can only 
refer to a single species (e.g., Thunnus thynnus  or Atlantic Bluefin Tuna)
– Genus level : label refers to a genus or to a common name that refers to species within a single genus (e.g., 
Mustelus spp."
"or Gummy shark)
– Family level :"
"label refers to a family or to a common name that refers to species within a single family (e.g., 
Scombridae or Tuna)
– Higher taxonomic level: label refers to a seafood group that includes species across multiple families (e.g., 
shark), or to a non-taxonomic generic name (e.g., fish or fillet).
"
"In order to define label specificity for each sample, the name recorded as ‘maximum level of detail’ was 
matched to a reference table of scientific names for all species (and their synonyms) associated with the common 
names or umbrella terms used in the labels (see Supplementary Table S1)."
"This comprehensive table of label-to-
species definitions was compiled for this study using the following databases: World Register of Marine  Species46, 
 FishBase47, the FAO ASFIS List of Species for Fishery Statistics  Purposes49, Fishes of  Australia48, and  AFNS50."
"The 
lowest taxonomic level shared between potential species within a given term defined the specificity of the label.
"
"Label specificity was compared across seafood groups, origin, and outlet type to describe patterns in label 
quality."
"We treated label specificity as an ordered categorical response and used ordinal regression to determine 
what factors influence the label specificity associated with each product."
"The ordinal categorical model was built 
using a generalised additive approach."
"We used a model selection process to identify the best models from a can-
didate set using the R package MuMIn (v1.47.1)79."
"We subsequently averaged the models in the 95% confidence 
set around the best model to build a model for inference and prediction.
Misnaming."
"Samples were considered misnamed when the common name used in the label did not match 
the  AFNS50 (available for download at www."
fishn  ames.
"com. au), which specifies one Standard Fish Name for an 
individual species or group of species."
"Misnaming in this context does not imply that the label is incorrect, but 
instead that it does not use the approved name for the product.
"
"Misnaming was determined by comparing both the maximum level of detail on the product label, along with a 
simplified version of the main label, with a list of all recognised AFNS terms at either a species or family grouping, 
or higher grouping level."
"If the name used in the label for a species did not match the AFNS recommendation, 
it was considered misnamed."
"Labels that included a scientific name for the species were considered as named 
correctly."
"We used the amatch  function in the R package stringdist  (v0.9.10)80 to account for slight mismatches 
such as plurals or spaces when matching against the AFNS labels.
"
Mislabelling.
"In contrast to misnaming, we take mislabelling to be the case when a label on a seafood prod-
uct does not correspond to the actual product, that is the label is misleading."
"To evaluate seafood mislabelling, we 
compared the maximum level of taxonomic detail provided in the original product label to the species identified 
by DNA barcoding (herein species match)."
"Each sample was classified as correct when the label coincided with 
the DNA barcode identification, and as mislabelled when they did not."
"When samples were labelled at higher 
taxonomic levels than species, these were classified correct when the DNA barcode identification falls within 
the taxonomic group defined in the label."
"For example, if a sample was labelled as ‘shark’ , it would be considered 
correct when the DNA barcode identification was any shark (i.e., a species of the subclass Elasmobranchii and 
superorder Selachimorpha)."
"Alternatively, a sample labelled ‘Gummy shark’ , a common name referring to Mus ‑
telus antarticus  and Mustelus lenticulatus , was only classified as correct when the DNA barcode identification 
coincided with either of these species associated to the common name."
"This step was done by using the same 
reference table (Supplementary Table S1), as described in specificity section."
"Results were checked individually 
to ensure allocations of mislabelling were accurate, including the use of any species synonyms in the label or 
the DNA sequence databases."
"For example, king prawn Penaeus plebejus has a sequence in the BOLD database 
labelled under the unaccepted synonym of Melicertus plebejus, thus requiring the synonym to be added to the 
reference table to ensure we do not erroneously identify a mislabeling event."

"
"www.nature.com/scientificreports/Mislabelling rates were estimated overall, and compared across seafood groups, origin, and outlet type."
"Mis-
labelling rates were also explored for each specificity level to facilitate comparison across studies and because 
products that are more vaguely labelled have different probabilities to match a species."
"For example, a product 
labelled at the species level would only correctly match a single species, while a species labelled at the family 
level would be considered correct if the match is any species within that family.
"
Sensitivity analysis of label‑to‑species definitions.
"Given the potential for variations in market names and species 
sold under a single common or umbrella  term20, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of dif-
ferent label-to-species definitions."
"Our table linking common names and umbrella terms to all possible scientific 
name matches (Supplementary Table S1) critically informed our decisions on both specificity and mislabeling. 
"
"For repeatability and transparency, we have therefore published this table alongside our scripts in the repository: 
https:// doi."
org/ 10.
5281/ zenodo.
"79622 11.
"
"By utilizing multiple sources, we compiled a comprehensive database of species corresponding to the various 
English names obtained from our sampling."
"Species can mostly be linked taxonomically to their relevant umbrella 
terms, for example, terms such as ‘flake’ and ‘shark’ were limited to species within the superorder Selachimorpha. 
"
"Meanwhile, terms like ‘snapper’ were accepted for taxonomically distinct species where common vernacular 
names include the word snapper (e.g., Pink snapper)."
"However, these umbrella terms can have a stricter defini -
tion under the AFNS—‘flake’ is defined as only two shark species, Mustelus antarcticus  and Mustelus lenticulatus  
in the AFNS as opposed to our definition that would consider 326 shark species to be a match under this term. 
"
"Similarly, the term ‘snapper’ refers to 98 species from 2 families in the AFNS but encompasses 123 species from 
5 families under our more comprehensive label-to-species definition.
"
"Therefore, we assessed mislabelling rates of Australian seafood products using stricter label-to-species defi -
nitions as per the AFNS."
"We also acknowledge the importance of the umbrella term ‘flake’ in our dataset given 
its popularity in Australia, its prominence in this study (i.e., 50 flake samples out of 97 shark products) and the 
ambiguity of this  term31."
"We report mislabelling rates of flake products using our comprehensive definition, 
the stricter AFNS definition (herein ‘strict flake’) and also by including holocephalans such as the commonly 
caught Callorhinchus millii  (herein ‘lenient flake’) in our definition."
"For example, a product labelled as ‘flake’ that 
was identified as a whaler shark (e.g., Carcharhinus obsurus ) was considered not mislabelled according to our 
label-to-species definition or to the lenient flake definition, but would be mislabelled according to the AFNS or 
strict flake definition.
"
Statistical analysis.
"Studies of mislabelling rates have historically struggled with the problem that differ -
ent products are labelled at different taxonomic levels."
"A common solution to this problem has been to limit 
sampling to products that are labelled at a species  level9,64."
"However, this introduces a sampling bias, as those 
products are likely to differ in important ways from others that are labelled more generically—for instance in 
price, market demand for information, ease of visual identification, or aspects of consumption.
"
"We treated products labelled above species level as being right-censored measurements—in statistics, right-
censoring is a condition in which the value of a measurement is only known at the last point of  measurement81,82. 
"
"In our case, measurement was taken in intervals at each of the levels of specificity, analogous to periods of time 
in traditional survival analyses, with most products not measured at the species level."
"The survreg  function in 
the R package Survival (v3.4.0)83 allows for a model to be built with mislabelling as the response variable with 
respect to specificity as the sampling interval."
"A survival regression was built using the same predictors as the 
ordinal regression described above."
"Again, we used the MuMin package to average the top 95% models resulting 
in the final model selection.
"
Predictive analysis of seafood mislabelling.  
"To remove label specificity bias and facilitate comparison across 
studies, we estimated the predicted mislabelling rates if all products sampled had been assessed at the species 
level."
"To standardize mislabelling rates at the species level we used the survival analysis model developed above 
to predict the highest specificity at which the product is expected to be correctly labelled or conversely the speci-
ficity at which we expect mislabelling to occur, if it does.
"
"Given any product mislabelled at any higher taxonomic level would also be incorrect at the next most specific 
level, proportions of mislabelling are cumulative from lower to higher specificity."
"A cumulative incidence curve 
across specificity levels was produced to determine the censored (i.e., measured) and predicted mislabelling rates 
at each level of specificity."
"The margin of error using the 95% confidence interval around the predicted point of 
mislabelling for each product were considered to generate an upper and lower estimate of predicted mislabelling 
rates."
"These were plotted as error bars around the predicted curve to show the deviation of the model’s results. 
"
"Moreover, we standardised all variables (i.e., using median or the most common values) and explored specifically 
the effect of seafood origin to determine if imported products were more likely to be mislabelled.

and tropical southwest Pacific 
Ocean

Swordfish (Xiphias gladius ) are a widely distributed (45°N–45°S) large pelagic fish targeted by fisheries 
worldwide."
"Swordfish that occur at high latitudes tend to disproportionately be large adults, so their 
movements have implications for population dynamics and fisheries management."
"In the southwest 
Pacific, little is known about this subset of the stock and existing evidence suggests limited movement 
from the subtropics into cooler high latitude waters."
"Here, we capitalize on the recent emergence 
of a recreational swordfish fishery off temperate southeast Australia to characterize movements of 
swordfish caught in the fishery with pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags."
"Data were recovered 
from tags deployed for 56–250 days on 11 swordfish (50–350 kg) tagged between 38 and 43°S in 
the western Tasman Sea."
"Five swordfish entered the Coral Sea (< 30°S), with four reaching north 
to 11–24°S, up to 3275 km away from location of capture."
"Behavior modelling suggests these four 
individuals rapidly transited north until encountering 23–27 °C water, at which point they lingered 
in the area for several months, consistent with spawning-related partial migration."
"One migrating 
swordfish still carrying a tag after the spawning season returned to ~ 120 km of its release location, 
suggesting site fidelity."
"Movements toward the central south Pacific were confined to two individuals 
crossing 165°E. Swordfish predominantly underwent normal diel vertical migration, descending 
into the mesopelagic zone at dawn (median daytime depth 494.9 m, 95% CI 460.4–529.5 m)."
"Light 
attenuation predicted daytime depth, with swordfish rising by up to 195 m in turbid water."
"At 
night, swordfish were deeper during the full moon, median night-time depth 45.8 m (37.8–55.5) m 
versus 18.0 m (14.9–21.8) m at new moon."
"Modelling fine-scale (10  min−1) swordfish depth revealed 
dynamic effects of moon phase varying predictably across time of night with implications for fisheries 
interactions."
"Studying highly migratory fishes near distribution limits allows characterization of the 
full range of movement phenotypes within a population, a key consideration for important fish stocks 
in changing oceans.
"
"The swordfish ( Xiphias gladius ) is a highly migratory, epi- and mesopelagic predator distributed throughout the 
world’s oceans from 45°N to 45°S1."
"The species is important ecologically and commercially, with annual global 
catches of over 100,000 metric tons since  20002."
"Swordfish are targeted along both the west and east coasts of 
Australia."
"While those targeted adjacent to the west coast of Australia are considered to be part of a single Indian 
Ocean biological  stock3,4, Pacific Ocean swordfish population structure to the east is more complex."
"Working 
hypotheses include two, three, and four  stocks5."
"For management purposes, however, the fish adjacent to the east 
coast of Australia are considered part of a southwest Pacific Ocean stock, managed by the Western and Central 
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)."
"The most recently available data indicated a southern hemisphere 
WCPFC harvest of 5,516 t in 2020, including 611 t harvested by Australian vessels endorsed in the Eastern Tuna 
and Billfish Fishery, and the fishery is currently considered ‘not overfished’ and ‘not subject to overfishing’6."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/While many aspects of swordfish movement behavior remain unresolved available evidence from the southwest 
Pacific suggests that the species’ population structure and susceptibility to fishing pressure may be influenced 
by their movement across the  region7–9."
"As such, characterizing movements and habitat use of swordfish both 
within the southwest Pacific and between adjoining regions remains a longstanding research priority to support 
fisheries  management7,10,11.
"
"The degree to which longitudinal (east ↔ west) movements of swordfish provide connectivity across and 
between regions of the Pacific Ocean is a key research gap."
"To date, conventionally and electronically tagged 
swordfish have largely maintained a regional association to release sites and tagging studies to date have not 
recorded trans-Pacific crossings in temperate  regions8,12–16."
"By contrast, genetic evidence is consistent with 
population connectivity across the temperate regions of the Pacific, which presumably would require some 
degree of longitudinal dispersal or migration of adult swordfish to maintain."
"For example, despite great distances 
separating sampled areas, no significant genetic differences have been found between swordfish sampled across 
temperate regions of the Pacific, nor between temperate regions of the northern and southern  hemispheres5. 
"
"Similarly, no evidence of differentiation was found in a SNP-based analysis of swordfish sampled across the 
southwest  Pacific17."
"However, the most comprehensive tagging study of southwest Pacific swordfish to date 
found limited evidence of connectivity across the  region8."
"Of 30 swordfish tagged with pop-up satellite archival 
transmitters (PSATs) in the vicinity of Australia (154°E–161°E)  in8, only three were reported to move east of 
165°E (dotted line; Fig.  1) and one east of 170°E into the vicinity of New Zealand."
"However, PSAT deployments 
 in8 were concentrated off subtropical southern Queensland where commercial fishing effort is focused, so it is 
possible greater longitudinal movements occur among subsets of swordfish occurring elsewhere in the region. 
"
"Resolving the degree of longitudinal movements of swordfish (particularly between the Tasman/Coral Sea and 
South Pacific region to the east) was recognized in the most recent stock assessment as a key research need to 
reduce uncertainty in the stock  status18.
"
"Genetic and tagging evidence suggest some degree of latitudinal (north  ↔ south) connectivity between the 
tropical and temperate areas within the southwest Pacific region (i.e., the Coral and Tasman Seas; Fig.  1), but a

"Of the 
aforementioned 30 swordfish that were tagged  in8 in the vicinity of Australia (between ~ 24°S–30°S), latitudinal 
displacements were largely between 20°S and 35°S, with a single swordfish crossing 40°S into cooler temperate 
waters."
"In contrast, in other regions where electronic tagging studies have been conducted, migration towards 
temperate or cold water to feed during summer months has been  reported12,19."
"This migration appears more 
common among larger individuals, particularly females (which grow substantially larger than males), which are 
thought to then return to warmer waters to spawn."
"While tagging to date has found limited evidence of move -
ment from the Coral Sea to cooler temperate waters of the southern Tasman Sea, available commercial catch data 
demonstrates swordfish have at least occasionally occurred in the Tasman Sea over the past 40 years, and that 
those caught at high latitude tend to be relatively large (Fig.  2)."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/daytime swordfish fishery in southeast Australia demonstrates notably large swordfish occur seasonally in tem-
perate areas of the southwest  Pacific20.
"
"In 2014, a small temperate Australian recreational fishery developed along the coasts of Victoria and Tasmania 
(38°S–43°S) due to the rapid adoption of the ‘deep-dropping’ fishing technique (i.e., targeting swordfish during 
the day with baits set well into the mesopelagic layer 300–700 m), and garnered international attention after 
yielding several swordfish line-class weight records within its first few  years20."
"The unprecedented access to large, 
high-latitude swordfish provided by this fishery delivered an opportunity to investigate possible spawning-related 
migration and resolve the degree of longitudinal and latitudinal movement among this subset of the southwest 
Pacific swordfish population.
"
"Some evidence suggests that the movements of swordfish are interspersed with periods of local association 
or site fidelity to particular  areas21,22, perhaps linked to  philopatry23."
"The behavior of fish returning to discern -
ible bathymetric features (e.g., continental slope anomalies or seamounts) could increase susceptibility of the 
species to localized depletion."
"For example, as the Australian domestic longline fishery rapidly expanded in the 
late 1990s from southeast Queensland, a pattern of serial depletion was identified, where favorable catch rates 
for swordfish could only be maintained in new areas on the periphery of the expanding fishery and declined 
the longer an area had been  fished9."
"The sequential decline trend was particularly evident in fishing areas that 
were associated with seamounts, but conversely, this trend was not noted for other target species of the fishery 
including striped marlin ( Kajikia audax ) and bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus )9."
"This finding suggests that relative 
to that of other highly migratory species, the movement behavior of swordfish may result in slower replenish -
ment from other regions."
"While the impact of the southeast Australian recreational fishery on the southwest 
Pacific swordfish population is presumably limited due to its present niche nature, the potential for susceptibility 
of swordfish to localized depletion is pertinent to the state-level management of the recreational fishery."
"Thus, 
quantifying movement behavior of swordfish in the region would inform recreational fishery assessment and 
management for what is typically a commercial target species managed at the Commonwealth (national) level.
"
"Along with horizontal movements, the vertical movement patterns of swordfish are important considerations 
for management because they determine the degree of overlap with the distributions of fishing gear and potential 
bycatch species."
"Swordfish typically undergo a diel vertical migration from the upper-mid epipelagic zone at night 
(< 100 m depth), where most targeted catch of swordfish occurs, to deeper and usually well into the mesopelagic 
zone during the day (i.e., 300–800 m depth; 8, 13, 14, 24), and thus out of reach of most fishing gears."
"However, 
the vertical movements of swordfish during both day and night vary with environmental conditions."
"Swordfish 
are thought to use vertical movement to maintain a preferred amount of ambient  light15,25, and greater water 
column light attenuation is linked to shallower daytime depth selection of tagged  swordfish14."
"During the day, 
low dissolved oxygen or temperature may limit the depth or duration of dives into the mesopelagic  zone15,25."
"As 
opportunistic predators, swordfish in some regions exhibit variable, shallower daytime behavior, likely linked to 
prey availability through the water column (e.g., mean daytime depth 234 m;26)."
"Occasionally, swordfish exhibit 
daytime ascents to near the surface, or ‘basking’14,15, likely to recover body  temperature27,28."
"Basking makes 
swordfish available for varying daytime  periods26,29, facilitating regional harpoon  fisheries30,31.
"
"At night, moon phase has been shown to influence vertical distribution of swordfish, with tagged fish sig-
nificantly deeper during bright full moons than dark new  moons24,32."
"The shift in depth, in turn, appears to 
influence interactions with fisheries."
"Perhaps due to gear differences (e.g., depth of hooks or nets), the reported 
effects of moon phase on swordfish catch per unit effort range from peaking at the full  moon33, new  moon34, or 
other  phases35–37."
"A better understanding of the environmental drivers of vertical movements of swordfish in the 
southwest Pacific will increase capacity to understand and manage fisheries dynamics by providing the capacity 
to capitalize on habitat  segregation26, since swordfish are often caught with an assemblage of species of manage-
ment and conservation  concern38,39, the composition of which varies with depth of fishing  gear40–42."
"Further, it 
is likely that environmental drivers like lunar phase can affect not just average night/day depth distributions, but 
differentially drive changes to the depth and timing of dives and ascents across the diel migration cycle."
"Despite 
availability of high-frequency depth data from archival tags, studies of swordfish movement to date have largely 
not examined effects of individual drivers on swordfish vertical movement behavior at fine temporal scale.
"
"Here, we characterize the movement behavior of swordfish caught in the temperate southeast Australian 
recreational fishery with pop-up satellite archival transmitters to address several key knowledge gaps."
"First, we 
determine the extent of longitudinal and latitudinal movements of swordfish to assess evidence for connectivity 
both within the southwest Pacific region and between adjacent regions."
"Next, we model seasonal movement 
behavior to investigate evidence of spawning-related migration as well as evidence of regional residency and 
seasonal site fidelity."
"Finally, we characterize the vertical habitat use of swordfish and identify factors that shape 
the species’ vertical migration behavior across the diel cycle, and environmental drivers of day and night depth 
distributions.
"
"Methods
Swordfish were caught and released on the southeast Australian continental shelf break between the months of 
March and July, from 2014 to 2021."
"Fishing was focused on areas frequented by recreational fishers targeting 
swordfish, specifically east of Eaglehawk Neck, Bicheno, and St. Helens in Tasmania; and south of Lakes Entrance 
and Mallacoota in Victoria (Fig.  1).
"
"Swordfish capture, tagging, and release."
"All fish tagged in this study were captured using the daytime 
deep-dropping method, with baits being set on the seafloor at 350–650 m depth before being allowed to slowly 
drift up through the water column  (see20 for details of fishing methodology)."
"As swordfish were brought to the 
side of the vessel, they were held in the water and their condition was assessed with a modified ACESS scale  5
Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:11812  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-38744-z
www.nature.com/scientificreports/to identify candidates suitable for  release20."
"For each swordfish released, a pop-up satellite archival transmitter 
(MiniPAT; Wildlife Computers, Redmond, W A, USA) was attached."
"The tags were rigged with a Domeier nylon 
umbrella dart tag  anchor45."
"The anchor was connected to the tag via a 200 kg breaking strain stainless steel 
multi-strand wire tether, covered in plastic heat-shrink and crimped to the corrodible release pin of the PSAT 
tag."
"Each PSAT was affixed in the musculature just below the dorsal fin using a purpose-made tagging pole, with 
the aim of inserting the anchor between two pterygiophores."
"After the tag was affixed, the weight of the fish was 
estimated and fish were then held alongside the vessel, which was moving forward at approximately 1–2 knots 
to provide gill perfusion until the fish freely kicked from the grip of the handler (“release”), and release location 
coordinates were recorded.
"
"Each tag was deployed in ‘standby’ mode and programmed to activate when wet and at a depth of greater 
than 2.5 m. The tags recorded pressure (converted to depth in meters of seawater, m), temperature (°C), and 
light level (lumens)."
"Tags deployed from 2015 onwards were programmed to detach from the fish after 250 days 
with a sampling interval of 10 min, with one fish programmed to detach after 365 days."
"The light attenuation 
coefficient was set at a constant 0.25."
"Alternatively, if the tag sinks to a depth greater than 1800 m or the depth of 
the tag does not change by greater than  ± 2.5 m over a 2-day period, the tag would also detach from the tether. 
"
"Once the tags detached from the fish, they floated to the sea surface where data was transmitted to the Advanced 
Research and Global Observation Satellite (ARGOS) system.
"
Geolocation estimation.
"Geographic position estimates of tagged swordfish were derived at twelve-hour 
intervals using a state-space model accessed through Wildlife Computers proprietary software, Global Position 
Estimator 3 (GPE3)."
"GPE3 uses the timing of dawn and dusk (as identified by the temporal profile of luminos-
ity intensity recorded onboard the tag); and comparisons of the depth recorded on the tag versus bathymetric 
data at the estimated  position46 and in situ sea surface temperature (SST; estimated when the tag was near the 
surface) versus remotely sensed reference SST  data47."
"These data inform a diffusion-based movement model 
to generate time-discrete 0.25° resolution gridded probability surfaces."
"GPE3 includes a speed parameter (the 
standard deviation of modelled diffusion rate) to account for biological plausibility of animal movement speed 
when estimating sequential positions."
"To allow for additive effects of currents in the southwest Pacific (e.g., up to 
1.5–2   ms−1 in the EAC and associated  eddies48,49) on swordfish movement rates, the parameter was set to 3   ms−1.
"
Behavioral state modelling.
"To investigate the dynamics of swordfish horizontal movement behavior, 
we estimated behavioral states and state-switching dynamics over time with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) 
implemented largely with the R package HMMoce50."
"This approach is similar to GPE3 in estimating positions on 
a discrete grid based on PSAT data, but additionally estimates a joint probability of both location and behavioral 
state at each time  step51."
"A state switching model with two states, a high diffusion state consistent with transi-
tory or migratory behavior and a low diffusion state, consistent with restricted movement or residency, was fit 
as follows."
"We started with the 0.25° resolution twelve-hour GPE3 position likelihood grids for each tag, as these 
already account for in situ bathymetry-, light- and SST-based likelihoods."
"Behavior state parameters (σ1 and σ2,

quent time step) were estimated with a genetic algorithm (noted by HMMoce authors to produce better param-
eter estimates than gradient-based optimization  alternatives50) with R package GA52 by maximizing model log 
likelihood in an HMM filtering  process50,53."
"The genetic algorithm was run with a population size of 200, prob-
ability of mutation of 0.12, and 120 maximum iterations, and model parameter optimization was constrained 
to 0.1–6.0 grid cells (0.25 × 0.25°) for σ1 and 0.001–1 grid cells for σ2, while state non-switching probabilities p11 
and p22 were constrained between 0.02–0.98."
"The lower bounds of the p parameters were increased to 0.12 in the 
case of poor optimization results, which occurred in one run."
"After parameter estimation, HMM filtering and 
smoothing were carried out with HMMoce to yield posterior distribution estimates of location and behavior of 
each tagged swordfish at twelve-hour intervals.

Vertical habitat use and movement behavior.
"Depth and temperature profile time series were visually 
inspected for anomalous data at the beginning and end of PSAT deployments (i.e., for post-release behavioral 
disruption or evidence of predation and consumption of the PSAT by a predator) and if present, data series 
were truncated accordingly."
"To characterize vertical movement behavior and habitat use of swordfish, a series of 
general additive models (GAMs) were constructed with the R package mgcv54."
"First, to characterize dynamic diel 
patterns in swordfish diving behavior, a GAM relating depth to smooth functions of covariates was fit to PSAT 
depth data (which is recorded at ten-minute frequency)."
"As tag depth (in meters of seawater) is constrained 
to positive values, and variance is expected to increase with mean depth, the following model (herein ‘vertical 
behavior model’) was fit with a gamma error distribution and a log link function:
where time  is time of day in decimal hours UTC (i.e., 10–13 h offset from local time in the southwest Pacific such 
that 24-h periods begin close to noon); day  is Julian day of year (rotated, such that 1  = March 1 and 366  = Febru -
ary 29); l  is latitude (in decimal degrees), moon  is lunar phase (in radians, such that 0 and 2π = new moon, and 
π = full moon, derived for each datum with the package lunar ; Lazaridis 2022); ζFish  is the random intercept for 
individual swordfish and εi is the residual error term."
"The type of smoothing functions (indicated by f  ) used 
varied according to the nature of the covariates."
"The interactions of time of day with other covariates, modelled 
as tensor interaction smooth functions, were of primary interest but the interacting covariates were also included depthi=f(time i)+f(

"The cyclical predictors (time, day, moon) were smoothed with cyclic cubic  splines56, such that 
means and first derivatives of these smooths were ‘wrapped’ (e.g., so time of day was continuous from 24 to 0 h), 
and latitude was smoothed with a thin plate  spline57."
"Individual-level smooth functions ( fFish) were included to 
account for any consistent individual differences in diel diving behavior or long-term vertical habitat use."
"To 
account for autocorrelation of sequential tag depth data, a first-order autocorrelation model was fit to the residu-
als of each tag, with the ρ coefficient chosen through model residual autocorrelation inspection with R package 
itsadug58."
"Smooths of time of day were allowed a basis dimension (k ) of 48 to accommodate acute shifts in depth 
across time of day, which induced a high degree of model complexity since several interaction terms include 
time ."
"Due to high model complexity, to ensure computational feasibility the model was fit with the mgcv  function 
bam(), with fast restricted maximum likelihood and discretization of covariate  values59."
"To assess whether the 
model was over-fitting the data, it was refit with 10% of the data withheld as a validation set."
"The retrained model 
was then used to predict depth values of the validation set, to examine whether the total deviance it explained 
among the validation set withheld from training was notably worse than that explained among the training data.
"
"To investigate environmental drivers of swordfish vertical habitat use, separate GAMs were built for day and 
night with median depth of each period as a response."
"Modelling daily median depths greatly reduced model 
complexity relative to the full vertical behavior model that included time of day interactions, and it also allowed 
modelling of independent effects of covariates on depth during daytime and night-time without the constraint 
of an autocorrelated relationship across each day."
"Daytime and night-time median depths were assigned the 
geographic coordinates of the most-likely (point) position estimated by GPE3 during each day or night period 
(positions were estimated at 00:00 and 12:00 UTC, corresponding to near mid- day/night in the study area 
respectively), and these coordinates were used for extraction of other covariates."
"Sun positions were estimated 
based on date and daily estimated location with the R package suncalc60."
"Based on evidence from the vertical 
behavior model and visual inspection of individual daily depth data series, the rapid shifts in depth consistent 
with vertical migration were observed to occur in the period spanning golden hour to astronomical twilight (or 
vice versa), and data recorded during this period (considered ‘twilight’) were omitted from calculating day and 
night median depths."
"Depth data were considered to have occurred during daytime if recorded between the end 
of morning golden hour and the start of evening golden hour (sun elevation > 6° above horizon), and during 
night-time if between the end and beginning of consecutive astronomical twilight periods (sun elevation  > 18° 
below horizon).
"
"Water temperature (°C), sea surface height (m), and mixed layer depth (m) were sourced from BRAN2020, an 
ocean reanalysis model that assimilates observation data to provide gridded estimates of data (daily 0.1° resolu-
tion) throughout the water  column61."
"Temperature from the top (2.5 m) depth layer (i.e., SST) and the 545 m 
depth layer were included as covariates, as these are roughly consistent with the bounds of habitat exposure of 
swordfish during the night and day, respectively."
"The diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K490,  m−1) was 
sourced from Level 3 MODIS AQUA data at monthly, 4 km spatial  resolution62 from  ERDDAP63 with the R pack -
age rerddapXtracto64,65."
"K490 is a measure of how much light intensity is lost to turbidity in the water column, 
such that  K490–1 is the distance in meters at which light is reduced log-fold (i.e. by ~ 73%)."
"Due to high levels of 
missing values, rather than extracting K490 at most likely location point estimates, mean values were aggregated 
across the  50th percentile contour of the GPE3 posterior likelihood grid of each 12-h timestep, weighted by posi-
tion likelihood across the grid.
"
"Hierarchical GAMs were built with both global and group-level smooth functions for each covariate to 
account for individual variation in  responses66."
"As night-time depth is typically near the surface and thus bound 
to positive values, its logarithm was modelled as a response."
"Full median night and day depths models initially 
fit were:
Non-cyclical variables were smoothed with thin-plate splines and moon  a cyclic spline as above."
"To account for 
individual variability without inducing artifact beyond the range of each individual’s spatial extent, a stationary 
spherical gaussian process with a range of 0.25° was used to model individual-level location terms of lat  and lon  
(longitude)56."
"As this approach assumes the units of geographic covariates represent the same distance, lon was 
scaled by the cosine of median lat  in the study area to approximate isotropy."
"Model selection was performed with 
the double penalty approach so that terms with negligible effect could be shrunk to  zero56, and terms that were 
penalized to zero were removed during model fitting."
"After selection of global covariate terms, model selection 
was repeated with the inclusion of fish-level smooths to ensure relationships were robust after accounting for 
individual variability."
"Fish-level smooths were fit with a penalty order m  = 1 to reduce concurvity with global 
 terms66."
"The global terms that were shrunk from the model upon refitting were removed along with the cor -
responding fish-level terms.

A total of 14 PSAT tags were deployed on swordfish during the study (Fig.  1).
"Two fish died soon after release and 
one tag did not  report20."
"The remaining 11 tags were deployed for durations between 56 and 250 days (Table  1). 
"
"Three tags reached full programmed deployment durations and eight tags reported prematurely, including three 
due to PSAT release pin failure, and one (SC0007) which reported 185 days after release but recorded consist -
ent, elevated temperature and irregular depth data during the final nine days, consistent with being consumed 
by a heterothermic predator (see Supplementary Fig. S1)."

Horizontal movements and behavior.
"Geolocation estimates revealed tagged swordfish dispersed as 
far north as 10°56′S and as far east as 173°39′E during PSAT deployments (Fig.  3), with maximum displacement 
from tagging location during deployments ranging from 202 to 3275 km (median: 1164 km).

"Behavior switching model parameters were optimized with consistent diffusion parameters (σ) across individ-
uals for each of the two behavior states of σ1 = 1.69 ± 0.10"
"(mean ± se) and σ2 = 0.49 ± 0.06 (Fig.  4a, Supplementary 
Table S1)."
"Probabilities of state persistence were optimized at  P11 = 0.62 ± 0.09 and  P22 = 0.87 ± 0.02, consistent 
with sustained periods of limited regional-scale movement (State 2, herein ‘lingering’), interspersed among some 
fish with periods of transitory, often cross-region movement (State 1, herein ‘transit’).
"
"Broadly, two patterns of seasonal horizontal movement are discernible, distinguished by the presence of 
protracted equatorward migration."
"Five swordfish (SC0004, SC0007, SC0008, SC0012, and SC0024) left the tem-
perate waters off southeast Australia in which they were tagged and transited into the Coral Sea, with the former 
four reaching minimum latitudes of  ~"
"11–24°S (Figs.  3, 4b)."
"Timing of equatorward migration varied: two fish 
transited to lower latitude in April, just after tag deployment, while the other two transited after approximately 
five months of lingering at high latitudes, in July and September."
"However, all four individuals demonstrated 
lingering behavior for several months after transiting to the Coral Sea, and sea surface water temperatures at 
the initiation of lingering were 23–27 °C (Fig.  5)."
"The single fish (SC0012) still carrying a PSAT after November 
transited back to temperate latitudes by the following January and resumed lingering behavior before PSAT 
release within 120 km of the location it was tagged, 250 days prior (Fig.  4b, Table  1), potentially indicating sea -
sonal migration between the Tasman Sea and Coral Sea.
"
"The other broad pattern consisted of predominantly or solely lingering behavior at high latitude, and was 
demonstrated by seven fish, none having moved into the Coral Sea (north of 30°S) for the duration of their PSAT 
deployments (Fig.  3)."
"Four of these fish (SC0013, SC0016, SC0019 and SC0023) remained in temperate waters 
south of 37°S, and another (SC0025) remained south of 34°S for the entirety of deployments of 56 to 164 days 
duration (Table  1)."
"The remaining two fish (SC0014 and SC0024) were slightly less restricted in latitudinal 
movement, with some transitory behavior recurring around 30–40°S rather than protracted equatorial transit, 
apart from the final week prior to SC0024’s tag release in which the fish rapidly transited northwest (Figs.  2, 4).
"
"The core residency distribution of transit behavior (Fig.  4c) reveals a discernible corridor heading northeast 
from the vicinity of the southeast Australian continental shelf break where tags were deployed."
"This corridor, 
which was used by four of the swordfish when transiting equatorward (Fig.  6), continues to the western edge of 
the Lord Howe Rise."
"At this point, transiting swordfish either continued north along the western edge of the Rise 
or continued northeast, traversing it."
"An additional, more diffuse corridor was discerned to the west, where four Table 1.  "

"Predicted depth 
profiles at intermediate lunar phases up to half-moon were not discernible from new moons (Supplementary 
Fig. S3), however at waxing gibbous phase (i.e., ¾ full), predicted depth across time of night was consistent or 
deeper than the full moon at the beginning of the night, then becoming shallower until consistent with the new 
moon at the end of the night, and the converse was predicted during the waning gibbous."
"These mirrored shifts 
in depth during gibbous moons coincide with the timing of moonrise and moonset on the respective waxing 
and waning phases (see Figs.  8f, Supplementary Fig. S4).
"
"The median daily daytime depth model explained 0.650 of total deviance and yielded an overall estimate 
of median daytime swordfish depth of 494.9 m (460.4–529.5 m; Fig.  9; see model summary in Supplementary 
Table S4)."
"There was no evidence of effects of moon phase, temperature at 545 m, or mixed layer depth on day-
time depth, as these terms were penalized out of the model during fitting."
"The light attenuation coefficient K490 
was the most important factor influencing daytime depth, with greater K490 (i.e., greater turbidity) resulting in 
shallower median swordfish depth by 195 m across the range of K490 values observed (0.02 to 0.11   m−1; Fig.  9d). 
"
"The model also provided evidence of positive relationships between daytime depth with sea surface temperature 
(especially across 13–20 °C i.e., the temperate Tasman Sea) and to a lesser degree, sea surface height (Fig.  9a,b). 
"
"The smooth of sea surface height was moderately concurve on sea surface temperature (Fig.  9e), likely due to the 
correlation between the oceanographic conditions with latitude."
"However, refitting with the sea surface height 
term removed did not notably change the influence of the other covariates (Supplementary Figure S5)."
"There 
was a fair degree of fish-level variability across the fish-level intercepts, with individual swordfish varying from 
the global mean daytime depth by 74.2 m shallower to 57.1 m deeper (Fig.  9e).
"
"The night-time depth model yielded evidence of an effect of moon phase while all other environmental pre -
dictors were penalized out of the model, with total deviance explained of 0.465 (Fig.  10a; see model summary 
in Supplementary Table S5)."
"The model estimated an overall estimate of median night-time swordfish depth 
of 26.4 m (20.0–34.8 m) while individual-level intercepts ranged between 8.0 m to 39.5 m (Fig.  10b)."
"Nightly 
median depth was similar across moon phases from last quarter to first quarter (i.e., while between new and 
half full), but between first and last quarters there was a pronounced increase in median night-time depth that 
peaked at the full moon (Fig.  10c), further supporting the effect demonstrated by the diel diving behavior model 
(Fig.  "
8).
"While all individual swordfish were predicted to respond to moon phase, the magnitudes of the fish-level 
smooths of moon phase varied thus the predicted strength of response at the full moon did as well (Fig.  10d).

Swordfish in the Pacific Ocean are currently managed at a broad spatial scale, but the ecological reality of man -
agement boundaries and degree of connectivity within them remains uncertain."
"This first description of the 
movements of the swordfish occurring at high cool-temperate latitudes in the southwest Pacific demonstrates this 
subset of relatively large, likely mature fish has a high propensity for latitudinal mixing."
"Five of eleven swordfish 
crossed from the temperate Tasman Sea into tropical waters of the Coral Sea, up to ~ 3,400 km north of the point 
of capture into water temperatures of 29.0 °C.
"
Partial migration between the Tasman and Coral Seas.
"The degree of latitudinal mixing demon-
strated by some of the fish tagged in this study was notably greater than among those previously tagged off the 
east coast of Australia near the aforementioned tropical-temperate boundary, for which the extent of north–
south movement was reported to be confined largely within 10° of  latitude8."
"Of 30 swordfish tagged with PSATs 
between 23.9° and 29.4°S, only four were observed to move south of 35°S and one south of 40°S, despite similar 
lengths of PSAT deployments as the current study (43–364 days, median 131 days;  see68)."
"In the present study, 
while five swordfish (45%) predominantly lingered in the temperate Tasman Sea with movements spanning 2–6° 
of latitude, six (55%) migrated over 10.9–32.9° of latitude."
"While limited in sample size (n = 11), taken together 
with the findings  of8, our results suggest a pattern of partial migration in the region, with a subset seasonally 
migrating between the Tasman Sea and Coral Sea, while other contingents remain regionally associated to either 
temperate or subtropical/tropical regions of the southwest Pacific.
"
"Several factors probably contribute to maintain the observed pattern of partial latitudinal migration between 
the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea."
"Occurrence in the Coral Sea, whether seasonal among the migrating contin-
gent observed in this study, or year-round among regionally associated swordfish previously  described8, likely 
reflects the distribution of habitat suitable for spawning, which is known to occur where sea surface temperature 
is at least 24 °C69."
"It has been postulated that swordfish caught and tagged in warmer waters may not need to 
migrate great latitudinal distances for reproduction as they are already in waters suitable for  spawning8."
"By con-
trast, most swordfish tagged in this study were presumably reproductively mature based on their  size69,70, and 
latitudinal migration from cool-temperate capture locations would be required for them to find spawning habitat.
"
"Four temperate-to-tropical migrating fish in this study demonstrated periods of lingering behavior in warm, 
low latitude water after transit north, consistent with finding and using spawning habitat."
"Two of the migrat-
ing swordfish began low latitude lingering in September and October, respectively, coinciding with the start of 
the spawning season east of Australia (Sept. to Mar.;69)."

peak of spawning season in the  region69.
"Two other migrating fish began lingering in June and July, 
before this spawning season, but they remained in the Coral Sea after its putative start, until the end of their 
tag deployments in October."
"Worth noting is that these individuals also initially transited further north (11°S 
and 19°S, respectively) than the 25–30°S area where sampling was focused to establish a spawning  season69."
"The 
spawning season of swordfish is probably more protracted in the tropics, as swordfish larvae occur north of 20°S 
in July–Sept. and year-round north of 10°S71."
"Thus, if the lingering behavior observed at low latitudes is spawning 
related, these results suggest swordfish off east Australia may have a broader spawning window than previously 
thought, facilitated by seasonal migration to suitable habitat.
"
"Seasonal lingering in the Coral Sea occurred across a wide geographic area, so if the behavior is related to 
reproduction, this finding suggests spawning does not occur at a discrete spawning ground."
"Available evidence 
suggests spawning may instead track the transient distribution of suitable oceanographic habitat."
"It has been 
reported that a greater proportion of spawning condition swordfish occurring among those sampled in the East 
Australia Current (EAC) than among those sampled within close proximity in the same month, but just east 
of the warm influence of the  EAC69."
"We found the latitudinal extent swordfish migrated into the Coral Sea was 
varied across the timing of the switch from transit to lingering: from ~ 10°S in austral winter (SC0007), ~"
"18–19°S 
in spring and autumn (SC0004 and SC0008, respectively), and SC0012 to ~ 25°S in late spring/summer (the 
spawning season at that latitude;69)."
"The switch from transit to lingering movement only occurred once water 
temperatures near the surface of 23–27 °C were encountered, suggesting the seasonal distribution of water warm 
enough for spawning may influence the extent of latitudinal seasonal migration.
"
"The occurrence of swordfish in the temperate southwest Pacific is likely related to the presence of foraging 
habitat."
"Due to upwelling and downwelling eddies shed from the EAC into nutrient-rich temperate waters, 
the western Tasman Sea is highly productive and has the greatest non-coastal chlorophyll levels in the South 
 Pacific72,73, providing a productive forage base."
"Relatively long latitudinal migrations of tracked swordfish into or 
both to-and-from cooler temperate waters have been reported from other regions globally, including the north-
west and north Atlantic  Ocean19,74–76, and the  northwest12 and northeast  Pacific14,15; as well as among other large 
predatory fish in the  Pacific77,78."
"It is unclear whether the swordfish that were not observed to migrate out of the 
Tasman Sea in this study remain resident there, since all but one tag deployment ended prior to the Dec.–Feb. 
"
peak of spawning  season69.
"If so, the pattern of high-latitude residency may indicate skipped spawning among 
a subset of the  population79."
"The one tag still deployed that had not yet left the Tasman Sea through the peak 
spawning season (SC0014) instead encountered > 25 °C surface water in the EAC near the New South Wales 
continental shelf late in summer 2016–17."
"Therefore, variability in oceanographic features might occasionally 
obviate the need for migration out of the Tasman Sea to reach habitat suitable for spawning."
"As possible skipped 
spawning or temporary extensions of spawning habitat suggested by our limited sample may have implications 
for stock productivity, future investigation with longer tag deployments would be worthwhile.
"
"While PSATs released from most of the migrating swordfish while they were still in the Coral Sea during the 
spawning season, SC0025 transited back to the Tasman Sea and was within 120 km of its capture location off  
southeast Tasmania when the tag released in February."
"This suggests the possibility of local site fidelity within 
the Tasman Sea."
"Site fidelity among large swordfish has been documented in the north  Pacific12,22 and also from 
the northwest Atlantic, where swordfish undertook seasonal cool-temperate to tropical migrations beginning 
in autumn and returned to close vicinity of their capture location by the following  summer19, a pattern also 
supported by conventional tag  recaptures80."
"A propensity for local site fidelity, especially if in association with 
discernible bathymetric features is likely to increase susceptibility of swordfish to localized  depletion9,23 and as 
such has been identified as a concern in the southwest Pacific that may warrant sub-regional  management81. 
"
"While the number of fish currently being caught by the southeast Australia recreational fishery is unlikely to 
have significant impact on the southwest Pacific swordfish stock overall, the fishery is confined to the narrow 
band of continental shelf break."
"In light of evidence of local site fidelity to this area, the recreational fishery 
would likely be affected by a local decline in abundance since the capacity to relocate fishing activity is inher -
ently limited."
"The historical trajectories of other recreational swordfish fisheries demonstrate that participation 
is highly sensitive to perceived changes in catch  rates20, and the potential for localized depletion will become 
an increasing concern if the number of fishers successfully engaging in the fishery expands in the future or if 
commercial catch in the area increases.
"
Evidence of regional connectivity.
"The tag data presented here appears to support the hypothesis of 
limited connectivity of swordfish between the Tasman and Coral Seas and South Pacific to the east, as fish largely 
remained in the Tasman/Coral Sea basin for the duration of tag deployments."
"However, two of the 11 tracked 
fish were observed moving east of 165°E (one detected ~ 173°E before PSAT release), nominally a greater propor -
tion than previously documented among swordfish tagged with PSATs near Australia (3 of 30;8)."
"While sample 
size is limited, it is worth noting the two fish in this study that moved east of 165°E were relatively large (est. 
"
"mass 140 and 280 kg) while the two that moved furthest east in the prior lower latitude Australian study were 
both 50 kg (est."
"dressed mass), the smallest of 30  tagged68, so these movements may reflect different underlying 
processes related to latitude between the two cohorts."
"The 165°E line of longitude separates regions used for the 
southwest Pacific stock assessment, and a greater relative degree of movement from the Tasman/Coral Sea into 
the South Pacific region to the east was noted to result in a more pessimistic stock status  estimate18."
"As such, 
further tagging work including fish caught at high latitudes in the Tasman Sea may be useful to elucidate the 
extent of longitudinal movements of swordfish in the region."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Diel vertical migration."
"Swordfish in this study overwhelmingly exhibited a pattern of diel vertical migra-
tion, descending during morning twilight into the mesopelagic zone typically to below 500 m depth, followed 
by an ascent back into the epipelagic zone during dusk."
"While day and night modal vertical distributions vary 
regionally, diel vertical migration into the mesopelagic zone has been reported fairly consistently across sword-
fish movement  studies8,13,14,24–27,29,74,75."
"It has been suggested swordfish diel vertical migration is structured such 
that it follows an isolume or narrow band of light  levels15,25, and as the main covariates of vertical movements 
identified are linked to light availability, our results appear to support a relationship of swordfish vertical move-
ments and ambient illuminance.
"
Moon phase influences nocturnal vertical movement behavior due to illuminance.
"The strong -
est predictor of night-time depth was moon phase, which has been identified previously to influence tagged 
swordfish vertical  position13,14,25, perhaps due to its influence on swordfish prey night-time  depth32."
"While we 
similarly demonstrate aggregated night-time depth increased around the full moon, by modelling tag depth at 
the finer temporal scale, we present evidence that this effect is notably variable across time of day — minimal 
near dusk and dawn and most pronounced between them."
"Since during the full moon, moonrise and moonset 
coincide with dusk and dawn and lunar downwelling illuminance is greatest between the two, this finding is 
consistent with illumination as the mechanism ultimately responsible."
"Similarly, we demonstrate that swordfish 
are also lower in the water column during near-full (i.e., gibbous) moon phases, but the effect is only present 
for the portion of the night that falls between moonrise and moonset."
"Lunar brightness increases exponentially 
with illuminated fraction (i.e., fullness), but the lunar contribution to downwelling luminance is similar across 
near-full moon phases as the peak elevation during full moon phases is lower in the  sky82."
"As the proportion of 
night-time during which the moon’s elevation is > 0° (i.e., above the horizon) is positively correlated to illumi-
nated fraction, it follows that a non-linear effect of moon phase on median swordfish night-time depth that gets 
more pronounced near the full moon should be expected assuming lunar illumination was responsible, which 
was observed in our night-time depth model."
"A similar pattern of daily aggregate night-time depth distributions 
being indistinguishable across moon phases up to ½–¾ full and then a pronounced increase in depth near the 
full moon was also documented among scattering layer  organisms83 that swordfish are known to prey upon, 
likely due to the aforementioned mechanism of correlation between duration of night-time visible moon and 
illuminated fraction."
"As such, these results illustrate the importance of accounting for the unsteady relationship 
of moon phase and nocturnal downwelling illuminance, including across time of night, when investigating the 
moon’s effects on marine  animals82,84.
"
"The dynamics of moon phase on vertical distribution across time of night identified here also have implica -
tions for understanding and predicting fisheries dynamics."
"For example, several fishing strategies or ‘métiers’ 
used among Australian vessels targeting swordfish in the Coral/Tasman Seas with overnight longline sets have 
previously been  identified85."
Longlines with 12–13 hooks per float (approx.
"20–120 m depth;  see41) are deployed 
later in the evening in métiers used on waxing moon phases (i.e., when the moon is up before/at sunset), and 
earlier in the afternoon in a métier employed predominantly during waning phases after the full moon when 
moonrise occurs during the night (see Figs. "
S7–S9  of85).
"Thus, use of these métiers by fishers appears to optimize 
gear deployment timing for presentation during moonrise/set, which is when our results suggest swordfish 
shift vertically through the epipelagic with the rapid change in nocturnal illumination, perhaps maximizing the 
chance of swordfish interacting with hooks across the depth range of the longline  catenary41."
"In regions where 
bycatch is a concern, characterizing the vertical dynamics of target species along with those of co-occurring 
species and fishing gear across moon phase and time of night would be particularly useful to inform targeted 
mitigation strategies.
"
Daytime vertical movement behavior and mesopelagic habitat use.
"Water column light attenu-
ation (K490) was the most important driver of swordfish daytime depth identified, with median daytime verti-
cal position of swordfish rising ~ 195 m across the K490 values observed and plateauing toward high values."
"A 
similar relationship was described  in14 and is consistent with swordfish maintaining low ambient illuminance by 
descending deeper in less turbid habitat."
"The greatest monthly K490 values were observed in the Tasman Sea, 
especially in spring during seasonal phytoplankton blooms.
"
"Notably, we did not find evidence that temperature at 545 m depth influenced swordfish vertical habitat 
use during the day, suggesting routine mesopelagic habitat use of swordfish may not be constrained by low 
temperature."
"Despite the low temperatures experienced by swordfish in the mesopelagic, previous studies also 
inferred a lack of thermal limitation at  depth8,14,15, perhaps because swordfish have a suite of functional adapta-
tions for success in the mesopelagic zone."
"Large  eyes86 with a uniquely adapted muscle that warms the brain 
and  eyes87 up to 15 °C above ambient water  temperature27 likely facilitate predatory success in dark cold water 
by providing superior visual  acuity88."
"Unique cardiorespiratory  adaptations89–91 appear to maintain function at 
low oxygen concentrations and across rapid large temperature changes experienced during vertical migration 
(e.g., swings of up to ∆ 22 °C between day and subsequent night in this study)."
"Some previous tracking studies 
suggest observed surface basking behavior functions to ameliorate thermal debt that accrues while at depth or 
speed  digestion13,14,29, because at equilibrium, swordfish only appear to be able to maintain muscle temperatures 
of ~ 1 °C above  ambient27,28."
"In this study, however, while swordfish occasionally entered the top 50 m of the water 
column during the day, they only exhibited potential surface basking behavior (PSAT depth ≤ 3 m;29) on less than 
2% of days on which shallow forays were recorded."
"The relationship of basking with environmental conditions 
is complex and is likely biotically mediated, for example by foraging  success14,29, and the reason for its dearth in 
the present study is unclear."
"Whether the daytime forays into warm epipelagic water documented here provide  18
Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:11812  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-38744-z
www.nature.com/scientificreports/the same proposed thermoregulatory role of surface basking documented in other regions or instead represent 
other functional behaviors (e.g.,  foraging26,  reproduction92) is an area worth future investigation.
"
"When in shallow epipelagic waters, swordfish maintain body temperatures similar to, or slightly above ambi-
ent, as they have a limited capacity for heterothermy outside of the  head28."
"Despite this, during dives into the 
cooler mesopelagic they can retain enough residual heat that body temperature remains elevated above ambient 
after several hours at  depth28."
"It follows that near-surface temperature may influence vertical habitat use in the 
cooler mesopelagic by determining how much residual heat the fish carry to depth, and we did find evidence 
that swordfish median daytime depth increased with sea surface temperature."
"However if this was a biologically-
mediated causal relationship, we would expect the temperature of mesopelagic habitat (i.e.,  temp545) to also have 
an effect on daytime vertical habitat use, since the rate of residual heat loss at a given depth would be depend -
ent on ambient temperature."
"As we did not find evidence of such an effect, we suggest sea surface temperature 
and similarly sea surface height may not be directly influencing swordfish use of mesopelagic habitat, and their 
modelled effects on median daytime depth may instead arise from latent correlation with unmodelled habitat 
covariates."
"For example, sea surface height and temperature are elevated in mesoscale anticyclonic eddies shed 
by the  EAC49,93."
"It has been hypothesized that swordfish may either preferentially use or have altered vertical 
distributions within these warm-core eddies, as swordfish catch rates within them are sometimes  elevated94–96. 
"
"Other oceanographic features that correlate with surface covariate anomalies, like fronts, have similarly been 
shown to produce high catch  rates97."
"Analyzing swordfish movement behavior in the context of potential prefer -
ence for and use of oceanographic features could enhance accuracy and precision of fisheries dynamics models 
such as forecasting and catch rate standardization (e.g.,98,99)."
"Although we were able to sample 1861 swordfish-
days with high coverage of some covariates (e.g., moon phase), the correlated nature of conditions in the pelagic 
environmental across our 11 PSAT deployments likely limited the degree to which drivers of swordfish behavior 
could be isolated."
"Additional sampling to improve coverage of spatial and temporal variability in the southwest 
Pacific (especially at low latitudes and in summer/early autumn) would likely allow stronger inferences about 
swordfish habitat use to be drawn.
"
What drives diel vertical migration of swordfish?
"A critical knowledge gap in the ecology of swordfish 
as well as other large diel vertical migrating pelagic predatory fishes concerns the apparent relationship between 
ambient light levels and vertical migration."
"It is broadly assumed that rather than light being directly causal, 
the association arises from bottom-up pressure as predators follow the migration of mid-trophic level prey in 
the deep scattering  layer100–102, which in turn vertically migrate in response to  light84 or more complex trophic 
 interactions103."
"Occasional swordfish deviations from constant-isolume diel vertical migration observed in some 
regions could also be explained by foraging-mediated vertical habitat selection, e.g., due to epipelagic prey avail-
ability or oxygen limitation of deep scattering layer  depth22,26."
"With few exceptions however (e.g. 104,105), the 
hypothesis that diel vertical migration is driven by prey availability has surprisingly not been tested  directly102.
"
"While swordfish are broadly considered opportunistic predators, gut content analyses suggest non-random 
selection for prey that varies with ontogeny and  location101,106,107."
"In the southwest Pacific, the taxonomic com -
position of and the proportion of organisms in the deep scattering layer that vertically migrate varies with depth 
through several hundred meters of the water  column108, 109."
"The presence of this complex, dynamically struc-
tured forage base along with evidence of swordfish prey selectivity suggests considerable scope for variation in 
a foraging-mediated model of swordfish vertical migration."
"Further, theoretical work on diel vertical migrating 
predator–prey interactions suggests individual variation in predatory strategies may be  expected110."
"The pres -
ence of stable individual variation in swordfish behavior or ‘personality’ that influences trophic interactions in 
the mesopelagic would have ecological and evolutionary  implications111, and the consistent differences in diel 
migration timing among two swordfish in this study may be preliminary evidence of such individual variation. 
"
"Other theoretical predictions suggest the vertical position of predators may be driven by a trade-off between 
both proximity to prey and light availability at  depth112."
"It follows that investigating swordfish movements in 
relation to both environmental conditions like illuminance and prey distribution in situ would be invaluable to 
understand their behavioral ecology and trophic interactions and degree of individual specialization therein, 
which has implications for understanding fisheries  dynamics75 and critical ecosystem functions like carbon 
 export113 in a changing ocean.
"
"Conclusions
The recent emergence of a recreational swordfish fishery near the species’ poleward range limit in the southwest 
Pacific has enabled a novel investigation of a high latitude subset of the population."
"These fish demonstrated a 
previously undocumented degree of connectivity between the temperate and tropical regions of the southwest 
Pacific, potentially to locate suitably warm spawning habitat."
"The sole migrating swordfish to still have a tag 
attached toward the end of the putative spawning season returned to within 120 km of its capture location, 
suggesting seasonal site fidelity."
"Two swordfish moved east of the 165°E parallel management boundary toward 
New Zealand, indicating a low but possibly greater degree of longitudinal connectivity across this management 
boundary than previously observed in the region."
"Variability in diel vertical migration into the mesopelagic zone 
during the day was related to light availability through factors like water column turbidity and moon phase, and 
the influence of the latter varies dynamically across time of night with implications for fisheries interactions. 
"
"The aspects of movement behavior documented here are likely to influence reproduction, regional connectiv -
ity, and both trophic and fisheries interactions, important considerations for our understanding of this unique 
epi- and mesopelagic predator."

Sustainable farming of fish species depends on emerging new feed ingredients, which can alter the 
features of the digestive tract and influence animals’ overall health."
"Recent research has shown 
that functional feeds hold great potential for enhancing fish robustness by evoking appropriate 
responses at the intestine level."
"However, there is a lack of extensive and accurate descriptions of the 
morphology of the gastrointestinal tract of most farmed fish."
"We have characterised the intestine 
of European seabass thoroughly, by targeting four segments − anterior, mid, posterior and rectum. 
"
"Results indicated that the anterior segment is mostly associated with absorption‑related features; 
this segment has the largest absorptive area, the longest villi, and the highest number of neutral 
goblet cells (GC)."
"The posterior segment and rectum have distinct histomorphometric features, but 
both seem to be important for immunity, displaying the highest count of acid GC and the highest 
expression of immune‑related genes."
"The strongest proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) signal 
was observed in the anterior intestine and rectum, with  PCNA+ cells appearing at the base of the villi 
and the corresponding villi branches."
"We have also evaluated the impact of a novel feed supplemented 
with a macro‑ and microalgae blend and found that there were no differences in terms of growth. 
"
"However, the alterations observed in the mid intestine of fish fed the blend, such as thickening of the 
submucosa and lamina propria, an increased number of leucocytes, and higher expression of immune‑  
and oxidative stress‑related genes, suggest that algae may have an immunomodulatory effect. 
"
"In the current article, we have described the morphology and expression patterns of the intestine 
segments of European seabass in detail and have presented a comprehensive report of the indices and 
methods used for the semi‑quantitative and quantitative histomorphometric assessments, thereby 
providing useful information for future studies that aim to maintain intestinal health through dietary 
interventions.
"
"Intestinal health indices are important for monitoring the welfare of farmed fish because some of the emerg-
ing new feed ingredients can alter the features of the digestive tract and have an effect on the overall health of 
 animals1."
"The intestine is not only involved in the absorption of nutrients, but it concurrently acts as a physi-
cal and chemical barrier to prevent the passage of harmful compounds and  microorganisms2,3."
"Nevertheless, 
extensive and accurate descriptions of the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract of farmed fish are few and 
far  between4,5.

"
"The concept of One-Health has prompted the aquaculture industry to search for ingredients capable of promot-
ing fish health and welfare and allowed functional feeds to gain  traction9,10."
"Macro- and microalgae are valuable 
sources of bioactive compounds that can act as immune  modulators11,12."
"Hence, algae are promising candidates 
for functional aquafeeds, with potential to boost the immune responses of farmed  fish13,14."
"To thoroughly under -
stand the functionality of such products, their impact at the intestinal level has to be delineated because this 
organ is the key site where diet evokes local immune  responses1.
"
"Integrated approaches, by combining histomorphometric indices and molecular biomarkers, can provide 
valuable information about the effects of novel feed ingredients on the morphology and functions of the intes -
tine of farmed  fish15–17."
"It should be noted, however, that morphologic traits can differ among species and along 
their intestinal tract, and studies on intestinal features still rely on traditional and laborious methods that largely 
vary among studies."
"The available literature commonly identifies three main intestinal segments in fish: anterior 
(or proximal), mid, and posterior (or distal)  intestine4,5,18,19."
"But since the fish intestine does not have easily 
distinguishable segments like those in mammals, there is currently no consensus on its morphological division 
and  nomenclature20, resulting in difficulties when comparing results across studies."
"For example, in studies on 
European seabass, the definition of the anterior and posterior intestines varies."
"Some define the anterior intestine 
as the segment from the pyloric caeca to the ileorectal valve, and the posterior intestine as the portion after this 
valve, i.e. the  rectum21."
"Others considered the posterior section and rectum as distinct portions of the posterior 
 intestine18."
"Furthermore, many studies fail to provide an accurate description of the intestinal portions used in 
their analysis, and the lack of a standardised terminology only adds to the confusion.
"
"Current histological parameters-based determination of the fish intestinal health depends on classical 
morphological changes, for example diet-induced adverse effects such as villi shortening."
"Many of the studies 
that have reported such morphological changes have relied on semi-qualitative  analyses22–24, but quantitative 
approaches at the intestine level are becoming increasingly  popular18,25."
"Moreover, a previous functional analysis 
based on transcriptomic profiling attributed specific functions to the segments of the European seabass intestine. 
"
"This analysis reported that the anterior and mid sections are mostly associated with feed digestion and nutrient 
absorption, whereas the posterior/rectal segments are especially relevant for immune  functions26."
"The posterior/
rectal regions are also the preferred sections for understanding the diet-induced modulation of the microbial 
 communities27–30."
"Nonetheless, the lack of a comprehensive study of the morphology and physiology of seabass 
intestine hampers the ability to selectively modulate specific targeted traits and hence contribute to precision 
nutrition.
"
"We wanted to establish reference methods and guidelines for morphological studies at the intestine level, and 
we believe that this information can be used to assess European seabass intestinal health status, so that results 
can be easily compared with future studies."
"Hence, we performed an in-depth characterization of four segments 
of the seabass intestine (i.e., anterior, mid, posterior and rectum) using definable indices and following a holistic 
approach: (1) fast-track image analysis combined with traditional histology methods; and (2) evaluation of the 
gene expression patterns in relation to immunity, oxidative stress, and nutrient transport."
"These methods were 
then used to understand the impact of a functional diet supplemented with both micro- and macroalgae on the 
intestinal structure of European seabass."
"To analyse the histomorphometric traits, both quantitative and semi-
quantitative assessments were performed to compare the performance of these two commonly used approaches 
for evaluating the intestinal health of fish.

Ethical statement."
"Fish rearing and sampling were conducted using routine and animal husbandry prac-
tices of commercial farming operations."
"The fish trial and experimental protocols were approved by the Ethical 
Committee of Riasearch Lda."
"(Murtosa, Portugal) overseen by the National Veterinary Authority (DGAV , Por -
tugal), in compliance with the guidelines of the European Union (Directive 2010/63/EU) and Portuguese law 
(Decreto-Lei no. 113/2013, de 7 de Agosto) on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes."
"The study 
is reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.
"
"Experimental diets, feeding trial and fish sampling."
"A commercial algae blend, which is composed 
of Gracilaria  sp., Nannochloropsis  sp. and Aurantiochytrium  sp., was produced by the Portuguese company 
ALGAplus (Ílhavo, Portugal)."
"Two isoproteic (51% dry matter, DM) and isoenergetic (23 kJ   g−1 DM) diets were 
formulated and produced by Sparos, Lda."
"(Olhão, Portugal): a control diet – CTRL –, with moderate levels of fish 
meal (15%); and an experimental diet with 2% of the algae blend – Blend (Supplementary Figure S1).
"
"The feeding trial was conducted in a saltwater recirculation system at the facilities of Riasearch Unipessoal 
Lda., Portugal."
"European seabass (initial body weight 118.6 ± 15.2 g) were randomly assigned to four 350 L fiber -
glass tanks (i.e., two tanks per dietary treatment) and fed the experimental diets for 8 weeks (54 days)."
"Fish were 
hand-fed three times a day and at the end of every feeding cycle, apparent satiation of the fish was confirmed 
through visual observation."
"The system conditions were as follows: water temperature of 20 °C, salinity of 18‰, 
flow rate at 700 L/h (200%/h) and 12 h light/12 h dark photoperiod regime.
"
"At the end of the feeding trial, and following a 48-h fasting period, 10 fish per tank were euthanised by 
anaesthetic overdose (MS222, 150 mg  L−1)."
"The different sections of the intestine were sampled, specifically the 
anterior region (i.e., right after the pyloric ceca), the mid intestine (i.e., the middle portion in between the anterior 
and posterior sections), the posterior region (i.e., right before the ileorectal valve), and the rectal section (i.e., 
right after the ileorectal valve)."
"Samples were carefully washed and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (pH 7.0  ± 0.1) for 
histological evaluation or deep-frozen for gene expression analysis by RT-PCR."

bass."
"After fixation, intestine samples were preserved in 70% ethanol."
"Samples were further processed 
according to standard histological procedures and embedded in paraffin."
"Five fish per tank were then selected 
for histological analyses (10 fish per dietary treatment)."
"Intestinal cross-sections (3 μm) were obtained using 
a semi-automated rotary microtome (Leica RM 2245) and stained with Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff (AB/
PAS; pH 2.5) and May Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG)."
"Both staining techniques can be used to quantitatively meas-
ure almost all the evaluated parameters, except for the determination of the number of GC (AB/PAS specific) 
and measurement of microvilli height and leucocyte counting (MGG specific)."
"Micrographs of each individual 
section were examined under a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Germany) with a camera (Olympus DP50). 
"
"The sections (i.e., one cross-section per intestinal sample) were analysed using both quantitative (Fig.  1 and Sup -
plementary Table S1) and semi-quantitative approaches (Table 1).
"
"A detailed description of the different histomorphological parameters evaluated quantitatively in the intestine 
of European seabass can be found in Supplementary Table S1."
"Briefly, two sections per sample were examined 
using an imaging software (Olympus cellSens Standard 2.2)."
"The AB/PAS-stained section was used to determine 
the cross-sectional perimeter (CSP), the absorption area, the villi length, the muscularis thickness, the submu -
cosa thickness, the lamina propria width and the number of goblet cells (GC), namely the acid and neutral GC 
(Fig.  1a)."
"The ratios villi length/CSP , GC/absorption area, acid GC/absorption area, and neutral GC/absorption 
area were also calculated."
"On the other hand, the MGG-stained section was used to measure the microvilli 
height, and to manually count the number of lymphoid cells and granulocytes in the submucosa and lamina 
propria (Fig.  1b)."
"As seen in Fig.  1c, the total number of acid and neutral GC and the absorptive area (total area 
occupied by the villi) were automatically determined using the analysis tools of the Olympus cellSens software.
"
"An immunohistochemical procedure was used to determine the localization of the proliferating cells using a 
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)."
"Firstly, the sections were dewaxed and rehydrated."
"Then antigen was retrieved by 
immersing the slides in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0), followed by irradiation on a microwave on high power

Strategy used for the quantitative analysis of the features of the intestine of European seabass.
"(a ) 
Sections were stained with Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid Schiff (AB/PAS) to detect the acid and neutral goblet cells 
(GC), and measure the villi length, the submucosa and lamina propria width, the muscularis thickness and 
the cross-sectional perimeter."
"(b ) Sections stained with May Grünwald-Giemsa (MGG) were used to measure 
the microvilli height, and to count the lymphoid cells and granulocytes in the submucosa and lamina propria. 
"
"Note the morphology of the different cells found in submucosa and lamina propria: granulocytes are big, oval-
shaped cells, with pink granules in the cytoplasm and a blue-stained nucleus in the periphery; lymphoid cells 
are small cells that stain blue; and erythrocytes are elongated cells with a pink cytoplasm and centrally located 
blue-stained nucleus."

"After cooling at room temperature, the slides were rinsed for 5 min in running tap water, 
and immunostained using the Novolink Polymer Detection System kit (RE7140-K, Leica Biosystems, Germany), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions."
"Thereafter the sections were incubated overnight with the primary 
antibody − anti-PCNA mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, EUA) in a humidified chamber, 
at 4 °C."
"The antibody was diluted 1:2000 in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 
"
Counterstaining was performed with haematoxylin.
"The area occupied by  PCNA+ cells was automatically deter -
mined by the Olympus cellSens software, using the same procedures that were adopted for counting the GC 
(Fig.  1c and Supplementary Table S1).
"
"Each MGG stained section was also semi-quantitively evaluated according to the criteria outlined in Table  1. 
"
"To evaluate each intestinal segment’s features, all samples were screened beforehand to ensure the accurate 
assignment of the score of 1, as morphologic traits vary throughout the tract."
"For example, in the anterior and 
rectum sections, a score of 1 indicates long, thin, well-organized villi with no tissue damage, while in the mid and 
posterior sections, it corresponds to medium-length villi with no tissue damage."
"Furthermore, as scores increase, 
so does the degree of alteration in comparison to score 1."
"This example demonstrates the importance of care-
fully assessing each section’s specific morphologic traits to assign accurate and reproducible scores."
"Concerning 
the scores range, while villi length and integrity, submucosa thickness, and lamina propria width were assigned 
scores of 1–9, submucosa lymphoid cells, submucosa granulocytes, lamina propria lymphoid cells, and lamina 
propria granulocytes were assigned scores of 1–5."
"These scores were considered the most appropriate to define

Expression of genes in the different intestinal sections of European seabass.
"Total RNA was 
extracted from the different intestinal sections (~ 30 mg; n = 16 per treatment), using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 
USA) and NZY Total RNA Isolation kit (NZYTech, Portugal), according to the method described by Ferreira 
et al.31."
"The quantity and purity of the extracted RNA were spectrophotometrically evaluated, while RNA integ-
rity was assessed using an agarose electrophoresis gel as previously  described17."
"Using 1 μg of RNA, first strand 
cDNA was synthesized, and real-time (RT) PCR assays were performed on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR 
Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) with SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, USA)."
"Following the protocol described by Ferreira et al.17, reactions were performed in duplicate. 
"
"The employed thermal cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of two steps of 95 °C for 
5 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The specificity of the RT-PCR reaction was ensured by a post-amplification dissociation 
curve, while PCR efficiency for each gene was determined using a fivefold serial dilution of cDNA from all the 
samples used in the experiment."
"A total of 22 genes (four reference genes and 18 target genes) were analysed, 
including genes associated with a) immunity (i.e., igM, immunoglobulin M; cd4 , cluster of differentiation 4; il-6, 
interleukin-6; il-8, interleukin-8; il-1β, interleukin-1 beta; tnf-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; tcrβ, T-cell recep-
tor antigen receptor beta chain; tlr9 , toll-like receptor 9; casp3, caspase 3; pcna , proliferating cell nuclear antigen; 
pisc1 , piscidine 1); b) oxidative stress (i.e., gpx , glutathione peroxidase; sod , superoxide dismutase; cat , catalase); 
and c) nutrient digestion and absorption (i.e., alp , alkaline phosphatase; malt , maltase; fabp2 , intestinal fatty acid 
binding protein; aqp1, aquaporin 1)."
"The primer sequences, accession numbers, annealing temperatures, and 
PCR efficiencies can be found in Supplementary Table S2."
"The stability of the reference genes (i.e., 18 s, β-actin, 
ef1α and gapdh ) was determined by the geNorm  algorithm32, within the qbase + software, version 3.2 (Biogazelle, 
Zwijnaarde, Belgium—www. qbase plus. com), and a normalization factor was calculated for each sample."
"The 
comparative critical threshold (ΔΔCT)  method33 was used to calculate the relative abundance of the target genes, 
as described by Ferreira et al.17.
"
Statistical analysis.
"The IBM SPSS software platform 27.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to per -
form statistical analysis."
"The assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances were checked by Kolmogo-
rov–Smirnov and Levene’s tests, respectively."
Data were transformed when necessary.
"For comparisons between 
intestinal sections, one-way ANOV A followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed."
"The level of 
significance used was P < 0.05."
"Independent samples t-test was applied to understand the differences between 
the two diets."
"A Spearmen’s rank correlation coefficient test was applied to the histology-based variables of the 
quantitative and semi-quantitative data."
"Significant correlations were considered at the bilateral levels of 0.05 or 
0.1."
The principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using XLSTAT version 2022.1.2.

"The average area of the GC (including acid and neutral cells) 
was also significantly larger in these sections (i.e., posterior intestine and rectum)."
"As for the GC and acid GC 
counts expressed per intestinal absorptive area, the highest values were for the posterior intestine, followed by 
the mid intestine and rectum, with the anterior intestine presenting the lowest value in comparison with all other 
sections."
"On the other hand, the anterior section had the highest count of neutral GC compared to the mid and 
posterior regions."
"However, when such neutral GC counts were expressed per absorptive area, we did not detect 
any significant differences between sections."

"A semi-quantitative analysis with well-defined and validated scoring system is described in Table  1 and was 
applied to the different intestinal sections in order to describe the intrinsic intestinal segment’s features (Sup-
plementary Table S3)."
"Likewise, the quantitative analyses, the semi-quantitative approach confirmed that the 
anterior intestine is characterized by long villi with very few irregular folds and a thin submucosa layer."
"The mid 
and posterior segments had medium sized villi with few irregular folds, and the rectum had a very thin lamina 
propria with very few granulocytes."

Gene expression patterns of the different sections of the intestine of European seabass.
"A 
panel of 18 genes, involved in immunity, oxidative stress and nutrient digestion and absorption, were selected 
to determine the gene expression patterns associated with the different sections of the intestine of European 
seabass (Fig.  3)."
"The expression of genes involved in the different immune pathways was, in general, higher in 
the rectum."
"Specifically, the mRNA levels of il-8, il-1β and tlr 9 were significantly higher in the rectum compared 
to all other sections."
"The genes cd4 , tnf-α, and tcrβ had higher expression in rectum only in comparison with 
the anterior and mid regions."
"In the rectum, the expression of igM  and casp3 was higher compared to only the 
mid intestine."
"The expression of il-6 was higher in both the anterior and rectal section but compared to only the 
mid segment."
"In contrast, the pcna  gene was found to have the highest transcript levels in the anterior region,

"There were no significant 
differences between the expression of the pisc1  gene in the different intestinal sections (Fig. 3a).
"
"The relative expression of genes associated with oxidative stress (i.e., sod and cat) differed significantly between 
the intestinal sections."
"The genes sod  and cat  were significantly downregulated in the rectum compared to all the 
other regions."
"The intestinal sections had similar levels of the mRNA of the gene gpx  (Fig.  3b).
"
"Concerning the genes related to nutrient digestion and absorption, the highest expression of the malt  gene 
was observed in the anterior region, followed by the mid and posterior intestine, with the rectum presenting 
the lowest expression of this gene."
"While the fabp2  gene was significantly lower in the rectum compared to all 
the other sections, the expression of aqp1  was lower in the anterior region compared to the mid, posterior, and

"The dif-
ferent intestinal sections were separated sequentially (as in the intestine) along the F1 axis, with the first two 
dimensions of the PCA biplot explaining 46.34% of the variability in the experimental data (Fig.  4)."
"The variables 
absorptive area, villi length, expression of the genes malt , fabp2 , sod and cat , cellular proliferation parameter

www.nature.com/scientificreports/area in the mid intestine was also significantly increased after the blend diet feeding (Table  3)."
"Alterations of the 
gene expression patterns were restricted to the mid region, with an upregulation of the il-8, pisc1  and gpx  genes 
in fish that consumed the algae-supplemented diet (Supplementary Figure S2)."
"The differences observed in the 
other intestinal sections, in response to the blend diet, were limited to a higher number of lymphoid cells counts 
in the submucosa of the rectum, and higher number of granulocytes in the submucosa of the anterior and rectal 
sections (Table 3).
"
"A PCA biplot created using all the analysed variables in each intestinal section could not discriminate between 
the CTRL and Blend samples (Supplementary Figure S3)."
"On the other hand, when only the variables signifi-
cantly affected by the experimental diet in the mid intestine were selected and visualised in a PCA biplot, the 
CTRL and Blend samples were separated along the F1 axis, with the first two dimensions explaining 60.64% of 
the variability of the data (Fig.  6)."
"The blend samples were associated with immune-related parameters such as 
expression of il-8 and the antimicrobial peptide pisc1 , the presence of the lymphoid cells in submucosa and lamina 
propria, and the presence of granulocytes in submucosa."
"The lamina propria width and submucosa thickness and 
the oxidative stress-related gene gpx were also found in the F1 positive quadrant, where the blend samples were 
mostly clustered."
"The variables villi length, GC, acid GC, acid GC per absorptive area and total area occupied 
by the GC were positioned on the F1 negative quadrant and seemed to be associated with the control samples.
"
Quantitative versus semi‑quantitative approaches for evaluation of the intestinal health.
"The 
experimental diet-induced alterations of the intestine histomorphology were evaluated both quantitatively 
(Table  3) and semi-quantitatively (Table  4)."
"In general, the differences captured by the quantitative assessment 
were also reflected in the semi-quantitative approach-based results, namely the increase in the submucosa thick-
ness and lamina propria width, higher number of lymphoid cells in the submucosa and lamina propria, and 
granulocytes in the submucosa of the mid intestine of blend-fed fish."
"But some differences detected through the 
quantitative approach could not be perceived by the semi-quantitative analysis, namely the effects of the blend-
diet on the villi length in the mid intestine, the increase in the lamina propria width in the anterior intestine and 
the rise in the number of granulocytes in the submucosa of the posterior intestine."
"Nevertheless, we observed 
a significant correlation between the variables of all the intestinal sections analysed quantitatively and semi-
quantitatively, i.e., villi length, submucosa thickness, and lamina propria width, and presence of leucocytes in the 
submucosa and lamina propria (Supplementary Figure S4).

"Discussion
The production and economic viability of the aquaculture sector are adversely impacted by the rising incidence 
of disease outbreaks in fish  farms7."
"Functional feeds are being recognised as promising tools to enhance fish 
 robustness10, a key factor for boosting the profitability of the aquaculture sector."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/farmed fish is intimately related to both nutrition and  immunity1, both of which can affect the morphology and 
functions of the intestine."
"To advance the field of fish intestinal health, we conducted a comprehensive charac -
terisation of the European seabass intestine and propose specific indices and detailed scoring system that were 
correlated with intestinal functionality.
"
"In a previous study, Verdile et al.5 performed a detailed examination of the intestine of rainbow trout (Onco -
rhynchus mykiss ), exploring different sections in specimens of varying weight ranges."
"Although growth-induced 
modifications of the intestine’s morphology were minimal, marked disparities were noted between the different 
sections of the intestine."
"Previous studies on European seabass intestine have only examined the  anterior25, 
posterior/rectal  segments18, or both the anterior and posterior  segments19."
"In contrast, our study provides a 
comprehensive analysis of the four distinct sections of the European seabass intestine − anterior, mid, posterior, 
and rectum."
"The histomorphological parameters, gene expression patterns, and the position of the associated 
clusters in the PCA plot indicate the distinct morphology, functionality, and location of the different segments 
of the intestine."
"The samples collected from the anterior segment were linked to parameters associated with the 
processes of digestion and absorption."
"This segment exhibited the largest absorptive area and the longest villi, as 
well as the thinnest submucosa and highest count of neutral GC."
"In fish, the intestinal mucus layer produced by 
the GC is thought to play different roles, ranging from lubrication, absorption and immune  defence34."
"The neu-
tral GC, in specific, have been previously linked with improved digestion and absorption in European  seabass19. 
"
"The gene patterns observed in this segment further corroborate the importance of the anterior intestine within 
the digestive tract of fish."
"The feed efficiency of fish is highly dependent on both the digestive enzymes and the 
proteins involved in nutrient transportation  processes35."
"In the present study, the involvement of anterior seg -
ment in the carbohydrates and lipid digestion and absorption is highlighted by the high expression of the genes 
encoding for the carbohydrate enzyme maltase ( malt ) and the fatty acid-binding protein 2 ( fabp2 ) observed in 
this section."
"Therefore, the increased surface area observed in the anterior intestine in comparison with the other 
segments, coupled with the highest counts of neutral mucin-secreting cells, and high expression of genes that 
encode for digestive and transport proteins indicate that the region has the ideal environment for both nutrient 
digestion and absorption, in accordance with previous  reports26.
"
The rectum and posterior intestine samples were found to be associated with immune-related variables.
"We 
observed the highest expression of immune-related genes in the rectum, followed, in general, by the posterior 
section."
"Moreover, the highest number of acid GC, that aid in protection against invading  pathogens36,37, were 
found in the posterior/rectal sections, highlighting the importance of these segments for the intestinal immunity. 
"
"A previous study examining in European seabass with a final body weight of 59 g revealed morphological differ -
ences between the posterior intestine and the  rectum18."
"Our results show that the rectum of European seabass has 
longer villi compared to the posterior intestine and the posterior intestine has a higher density of GC, corrobo -
rating the findings of Torrecillas et al.18."
"In contrast to this study, we observed no variation in submucosa width 
between the posterior intestine and rectum, despite the latter having more lymphoid cells in the submucosa."
"These 
differences could be attributed to variations in fish body size (i.e., 60 vs 200 g in the present study) or exposure 
to different environmental challenges that might affect leucocyte infiltration."
"Our study compared four separate 
segments along the intestinal tract and revealed marked morphological differences in the rectum compared to 
the other three sections."
"Specifically, this region displayed the thickest muscularis, narrowest lamina propria, 
and longest microvilli."
"The thick muscularis layer observed in rectum suggests that intestinal  motility38 is crucial 
in this section, potentially for the release of waste."
"In addition, the longer microvilli of the rectum indicate that 
some important absorption processes still occur in this segment."
"When examining the gene expression patterns, 
it appears that the rectum is primarily involved in water absorption, rather than nutrient digestion, as compared 
to the other segments."
"As one of the main osmoregulatory organs in marine teleost, the intestinal epithelium plays 
a key role in water transport-processes through the action of membrane proteins, such as  aquaporins39."
"Similarly 
to findings reported by Giffard-Mena et al.40, the mid, posterior, and rectal segments of the intestine seem to be Table 4.  "
"Histomorphology of the different intestine sections of European seabass fed the control or the blend 
diets using a semi-quantitative analysis."
"CTRL – fish fed the control diet, Blend – fish fed the blend diet."
"Scores 
1–9 were assigned to villi length/integrity, submucosa width, and lamina propria width; while scores 1–5 
were assigned to denote the presence of leucocytes (i.e., lymphoid cells and granulocytes) in the submucosa 
and lamina propria."
"Values presented as mean ± SD (n = 10 samples per dietary treatment), based on a semi-
quantitative analysis."
"Independent samples t-test was employed to detect significant differences between 
the groups within each intestinal section."
"Different letters denote significant differences between dietary 
treatments."

their high expression of aqp1  compared to the anterior section.
"
"The expression levels of the intestinal brush border membrane enzymes herein studied were segment-specific, 
except for alkaline phosphatase (alp )."
"This enzyme displayed a consistent expression pattern across all the intes-
tinal segments."
"The intestinal alp  has been recognised for its role in preventing inflammation, both in the gut 
and at the systemic  level41."
"According to the PCA plot, the variables malt  and fabp2  were found to be associated 
with the anterior section, along with other digestion/absorption-related parameters."
"In contrast, the expression 
of the alp  gene appeared in the quadrants where the posterior and rectum samples clustered, in association with 
immune-related variables."
"Therefore, the ubiquitous expression of the alp  gene throughout the intestine may 
play a role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, which supports previous  findings42.
"
"The selected gene expression patterns were unable to differentiate between the mid and posterior regions. 
"
"Nonetheless, several histomorphometric indices, such as the absorption area, microvilli height, number of GC 
and acid GC, area of GC, and quantity of leucocytes in the submucosa and lamina propria, were able to distin -
guish these regions."
"While the posterior intestine samples were positioned in the same quadrant of the PCA biplot 
as the rectum samples, the mid intestine samples clustered in a specific area of the PCA biplot, and without any 
clear association with the assessed variables."
"The mid intestine seems, therefore, to be an intermediate region 
for both absorption and immune-related processes.
"
"In order to understand the turnover of the enterocytes in different sections of the intestine, we analysed the 
localization and distribution of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by immunostaining positive cells. 
"
"The anterior portion of the intestine, followed by the rectum, had the strongest PCNA signalling, although there 
were differences in localization."
"Similar to what was observed in rainbow  trout5, the PCNA signal was detected 
both at the basis of the villi and at the villi branching points in the anterior intestine of European seabass, while 
in the rectum, PCNA immunolocalization was restricted to the base of the folds."
"The results suggest that the stem 
cell zone is most likely located at the basal part of the villi."
"This is consistent with previous findings in rainbow 
trout by Verdile et al.43, who found that the sox9+ cell zone (a marker for stem cells) in the intestine was similar 
to the  PCNA+ cell zone."
"The understanding of the stem-cell population’s localization in the gastrointestinal tract 
is crucial for the development of novel in vitro tools, such as organoids, for the study of fish intestine."
"Organoids 
have recently emerged as one of the most promising tools for studying the intestinal health of farmed  animals44.
"
"Fish nutrition studies should accurately report the impacts of feeds on the intestinal health, and for this it is 
important to precisely describe the changes in the intestine segment selected for the analysis."
"Based on our find-
ings, we propose that the intestine of European seabass can be divided into four different segments with unique 
morphological and/or gene expression profiles: 1) the anterior intestine, 2) the mid intestine, 3) the posterior 
intestine, and 4) the rectum."
"It is important to note that the length of the intestine can vary with fish size, and 
therefore, we recommend a standardized method for identifying and sampling these segments."
"Specifically, the 
anterior intestine should be sampled immediately after the pyloric ceca; the mid intestine should be sampled 
from the middle region between the pyloric ceca and the ileorectal valve, the posterior intestine should be the 
portion preceding the ileorectal valve, and the rectum should be the segment immediately after the ileorectal 
valve."
"Using this standardized approach for sample collection and nomenclature for intestine segments will ensure 
consistent and accurate reporting of feed impacts on intestinal health and allow comparison with future studies.
"
"After conducting a detailed study on the different intestinal segments of European seabass, we aimed to inves-
tigate the effects of a novel macro- and microalgae blend on the intestinal functionality of the fish."
"Although the 
dietary inclusion of the blend did not affect fish growth performance or feed utilization parameters, the results 
suggest that the diet can alter the intestine morphology."
"Most studies that evaluated fish feed utilization and 
immune status relied either on the anterior intestinal  segment19 or on the posterior/rectal  segment18, respectively. 
"
"However, in this study, the subtle differences between the CTRL and the Blend diet were mostly perceived in 
the mid intestine."
"When the impact of the blend was evaluated in the different intestinal segments using either a 
quantitative or semi-quantitative approach, the mid section presented, in general, the highest response towards 
the diet, which may indicate that this segment is more sensitive to external stimuli."
"The feeding trial lasted for 
only 8 weeks, hence the observed villi shortening and the reduced number of acid GC in the mid intestine are 
likely to be an adaptive response to the diet."
"Further evaluation of such alterations in the intestine structure is 
required after a longer-term feeding trial."
"Nonetheless, some immunomodulatory effects were already observed 
in various intestinal sections, including thickening of the submucosa (mid intestine), widening of the lamina 
propria (anterior and mid sections), an increase in the number of lymphoid cells in the submucosa (mid and 
rectum segments), granulocytes in the submucosa (all sections), and lymphoid cells in the lamina propria of the 
mid intestine."
"These observations, along with the increased expression of immune- and oxidative stress-related 
genes (il-8, pisc1  and gpx ), in the mid region, point towards an immunomodulatory effect promoted by the 
algae blend."
"This potential functionality should be further explored after a disease challenge, such as a bacterial 
infection."
"However, it is important to note that experimental conditions, namely temperature and salinity, can 
influence gut structure and functionality and yield varying  outcomes45–47."
"In a previous study, we observed that 
European seabass fed a micro- and macroalgae blend and reared under similar temperature conditions as the 
present trial (21 °C), but with higher salinity levels (35‰), had an enhanced mucosal immune response upon 
infection with Tenacibaculum maritium17."
"Overall, these results suggest that dietary supplementation with algae 
could be a promising strategy to improve the robustness of European seabass.
"
"To evaluate the impact of feeds on fish intestinal health, researchers have often conducted a semi-quantitative/
score-based analysis focused on a determined intestinal segment."
"Such scoring system commonly used in litera -
ture often lacks clear definition and description of the selected indices and can lead to unreproducible  results48,49. 
"
"Moreover, due to the lack of a well-defined and validated scoring system, it is more likely for untrained individu-
als to make errors and have unreproducible  results20."
"As morphologic traits vary throughout the tract, it is crucial 
to assess each section’s specific morphologic traits and all samples beforehand to ensure the accurate assignment  13
Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports  |        (2023) 13:11686  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-38826-y
www.nature.com/scientificreports/of the score."
"Hence, our study provides a detailed description of a set of scores for the semi-quantitative assess -
ment of several morphological parameters of the intestine such as 1) villi length and integrity; 2) submucosa 
thickness; 3) lamina propria width; 4) submucosa lymphoid cells; 5) submucosa granulocytes; 6) lamina propria 
lymphoid cells; and 7) lamina propria granulocytes."
"The proposed scoring system includes validated and clearly 
defined criteria for each intestinal section, allowing researchers to select a scoring method that generates reli -
able and consistent data."
"Alternatively, recent studies investigating the morphology of the intestine have utilized 
quantitative approaches to produce precise  measurements18–20."
"In the present work, we have also developed a 
detailed description of the indices and methods used for the quantitative assessment, which also allow direct 
comparisons among intestinal segments."
"We have used an image analysis software to automatically estimate 
the absorptive area, count the GC, and evaluate cellular proliferation (determined by the total area occupied by 
 PCNA+ cells)."
"For all other parameters, we have employed a semi-automatic approach."
"The quantitative assess -
ment method enables us to measure the same parameters that are commonly evaluated through a score-based 
analysis (e.g., villi length, submucosa and lamina propria widths, and leucocyte infiltration)20,48–50, as well as 
several other additional parameters such as total absorptive area, muscularis thickness, and total GC counts in a 
cross-section."
"This approach has enormous potential to further evolve into a completely reliable automatic image 
analysis using artificial intelligence technologies for fast-track evaluation of fish intestinal health.
"
"Although the semi-quantitative analysis is a less time-consuming and relatively easier method to assess the 
intestine histomorphology, it relies on pre-defined scores, which can increase  bias51."
"In addition, unlike the 
quantitative assessment, the semi-quantitative analysis requires highly trained and experienced  observers20. 
"
"In the present study, we found a significant correlation between the values obtained by both quantitative and 
semi-quantitative analyses for the parameters evaluated within each intestinal segment."
"This indicates that both 
methods are valid for assessing intestinal health."
"While the semi-quantitative analysis may be useful for a quick 
pre-assessment, it is important to define the scoring system correctly to ensure good repeatability."
"However, we 
prefer the quantitative approach overall, as it allows for more easily comparable measurements across studies."
"To 
ensure robust and reproducible data from both methods, it is crucial that studies provide a detailed description 
of the methodology for each index in the methodology section.
"
"In conclusion, by providing an in-depth characterisation of the different segments of the intestine (i.e., 
anterior, mid, posterior, and rectal) of European seabass, the present study provides valuable information about 
the intestinal morphology."
"Overall, we found that histological characteristics and gene expression profiles were 
specific to each intestinal segment."
"The anterior region appears to be primarily associated with absorption 
processes, with the largest absorptive area, longest villi, and a high expression of genes encoding digestive and 
transport proteins."
"In contrast, the rectum, followed by the posterior intestine, displayed the highest expression 
values for immune-related genes, highlighting their importance for mucosal immunity."
"The thick muscularis 
and long microvilli observed in rectum, coupled the high expression of the aqp1 gene, most likely indicates that 
both waste release and water absorption are also important processes occurring in this segment."
"Finally, the mid 
intestine appears to be a transitional region for both absorption and immunity."
"Hence, the generated knowledge 
can assist in arriving at better decisions regarding the choice of the appropriate segment and morphometric 
indices for future experiments to study nutritional modulation and its effects on intestinal health."
"Furthermore, 
transition from a semi-quantitative to a quantitative analysis of intestine histomorphology is crucial for adopting 
digital technologies that produce more precise and fast histology-based results."
"As a futuristic perspective, the 
quantitative analysis offers a promising avenue for machine learning approaches in this field, allowing for high 
throughput image analysis of intestinal histological sections using artificial intelligence.

www.nature.com/scientificreportsPast climate‑driven range 
shifts structuring intraspecific 
biodiversity levels of the giant kelp 
(Macrocystis pyrifera ) at global 
scales

The paradigm of past climate‑driven range shifts structuring the distribution of marine intraspecific 
biodiversity lacks replication in biological models exposed to comparable limiting conditions in 
independent regions."
This may lead to confounding effects unlinked to climate drivers.
"We aim to 
fill in this gap by asking whether the global distribution of intraspecific biodiversity of giant kelp 
(Macrocystis pyrifera) is explained by past climate changes occurring across the two hemispheres."
"We 
compared the species’ population genetic diversity and structure inferred with microsatellite markers, 
with range shifts and long‑term refugial regions predicted with species distribution modelling (SDM) 
from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the present."
"The broad antitropical distribution of Macrocystis 
pyrifera is composed by six significantly differentiated genetic groups, for which current genetic 
diversity levels match the expectations of past climate changes."
"Range shifts from the LGM to the 
present structured low latitude refugial regions where genetic relics with higher and unique diversity 
were found (particularly in the Channel Islands of California and in Peru), while post ‑glacial expansions 
following ~ 40% range contraction explained extensive regions with homogenous reduced diversity. 
"
"The estimated effect of past climate‑driven range shifts was comparable between hemispheres, 
largely demonstrating that the distribution of intraspecific marine biodiversity can be structured 
by comparable evolutionary forces across the global ocean."
"Additionally, the differentiation and 
endemicity of regional genetic groups, confers high conservation value to these localized intraspecific 
biodiversity hotspots of giant kelp forests.
"
"The distribution of cold and temperate marine biodiversity at the infraspecific level often carries the footprints of 
past climate-driven range  shifts1–3."
"Particularly well reported are range shifts of low dispersive or sessile species 
driven by glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary (c. 2.6 Myr to the present)."
"The advance of ice sheets and 
compression of isotherms during glacial periods (e.g., Last glacial Maximum; c. 20 Kyr ago)4,5 caused poleward 
range contractions and lower latitude  expansions2,6–9, while the opposite trend would have happened during inter -
glacials (e.g., Holocene; c. 12 Kyr to the present)9–13."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/climatic refugia are expected, where populations could have persisted for sufficient time to enable the evolution 
of genetic hotspots and endemic  lineages7."
"In contrast, where extinctions/recolonizations occurred, popula -
tions tend to be genetically depauperate and highly homogeneous due to genetic bottlenecks along colonization 
 fronts7,14–17."
"Despite the paradigm of past climate-driven range shifts in structuring intraspecific biodiversity, 
biological models exposed to comparable conditions in independent geographic regions are rarely available to 
allow for independent replicated assessment.
"
"The higher latitude regions of the Northern vs. Southern hemispheres provided contrasting evolutionary con-
ditions for marine coastal species, particularly considering the differences in ice extent and shoreline morphology 
during glacial  periods18."
"The Northern hemisphere was buried under thick layers of permanent ice down to the 
latitudes matching Brittany (France) and Maine (USA) in the Atlantic Ocean, and Vancouver Island (Canada) in 
the Pacific  Ocean5."
"In the Southern hemisphere, besides Antarctica and its surrounding islands, only Patagonia 
was severely  affected18, thus providing additional opportunities for population persistence."
"However, a large 
portion of the Southern Hemisphere’s coasts are distributed in tropical areas, potentially providing less suitable 
habitat for cold-temperate species than in the Northern Hemisphere, where the coastline is more continuous 
from equatorial to Arctic regions."
"Major shifts in southern oceanic circulation, led by the intensification of the 
Circumpolar Antarctic Current (ACC) during LGM, likely added complexity to the glacial seascape, even in 
regions not affected by ice cover."
"For instance, the strong cooling of the Humboldt Current may have provided 
suitable habitat even in the inter-tropical  zone19."
"Another peculiarity of the Southern hemisphere is the role of 
trans-oceanic dispersal at the end of LGM, leading to eastward (e.g., from New Zealand to Chile), instead of 
southward recolonization of many species in Patagonia and other sub-Antarctic  regions20–22."
"Numerous studies 
across the globe have shown the genetic effects of past climate  changes2,10,11,14,23,24, but comparisons between 
hemispheres are lacking."
"Additionally, while the role of refugia as sources for poleward expansions is well‐
documented, the effect of past genetic bottlenecks at lower latitudes is insufficiently  understood8."
"Testing the 
drivers of intraspecific biodiversity on a single model species distributed in both hemispheres reduces potential 
confounding effects linked to comparing species’ specific responses to climate changes, which can largely result 
from interspecific niche  differentiation25,26.
"
"The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera represents an ideal model to address the topic owing to its broad antitropi-
cal  distribution27, with past distributional edges exposed to replicate conditions of higher (cold) and lower (warm) 
latitudes of both hemispheres."
"Additionally, its limited spore dispersal and ability to promote density barriers by 
local saturation of available  habitats28 may allow retaining the signatures left by past demographic  changes2,8,10. 
"
"Giant kelp can further perform long ‐distance dispersal events by  rafting29, potentially extending distributional 
ranges and following climate velocity changes across whole biogeographic regions."
"Most importantly, while 
describing the drivers of intraspecific biodiversity, the identification of endemic genetic lineages for giant kelp 
is timely, as regional persistence might be currently threatened by ongoing and projected climate  changes30,31. 
"
"The recent increase in frequency and intensity of marine heat wave events has been linked to regional losses of 
the species in both  hemispheres32,33, which can erode global diversity levels and shift genetic  baselines34."
"These 
losses can also threaten the multiple ecosystem services provided, such as the role in blue carbon sequestration 
and coastal protection, as well as the nursery effect for numerous economically important  species27,35–37.
"
"Previous genetic studies with Macrocystis pyrifera were mostly performed without broadscale replication 
across the hemispheres."
"These aimed to explore the patterns of the species’ genetic  structure38–41, disentangle 
the effect of quaternary climate change fluctuations in the distribution and productivity of the  species42, the 
role of seascape drivers mediating genetic differentiation, by testing the role of isolation by habitat continuity, 
environment and ocean  transport39,43,44 , as well as the vulnerability of populations to ongoing climatic  stress45. 
"
"Three studies sampling populations across the two  hemispheres46,47 showed (1) Macrocystis as a monospecific 
genus based on two genetically distinguishable ecomorphs, M. pyrifera  and M. integrifolia , (2) the  northern46–48 
hemisphere distribution as the potential ancestral origin of the genus, with consequently reduced genetic diversity 
in the southern hemisphere, and (3) highlighted the potential role of ice advances in structuring the distribution 
of genetic diversity."
"Y et, studies lacked independent estimates of past climate oscillations (e.g., SDM-based), were 
mostly performed with traditional mtDNA markers, typically prone to selection and poor  resolution48, and were 
limited in sampling design."
"These together might have limited conclusions on how climate-driven range shifts 
structured the species’ intraspecific biodiversity of giant kelp.
"
"In this study, we asked whether the distribution of intraspecific marine biodiversity is explained by past 
climate‐driven range shifts across the hemispheres."
"We compared the genetic variability of Macrocystis pyrifera, 
estimated across the species’ entire distributional range, with independent Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) 
predicting past range shifts and long-term refugial regions from the last glacial maximum to the present."
"Overall, 
we hypothesize that the exposure to comparable past climate changes in the two hemispheres structured disjunct 
long-term refugial regions currently displaying higher and unique gene pools, relative to regions more recently 
colonized (i.e., resulting from post-glacial expansions).
"
"Methods
The study area comprised the entire distributional range of Macrocystis pyrifera , from Alaska to Baja California 
Sur (Mexico) in the northeast hemisphere, and from Peru to Tierra del Fuego (Argentina), as well as South Africa, 
Australia, New Zealand and sub-Antarctic Islands in the southern hemisphere.

"
"Biologically meaningful benthic predictors (i.e., along bottom layers) for the  species29 were  developed52 for the 
present-day and the LGM conditions using the computation pipelines of Bio-ORACLE51."
"These reflected essen-
tial resources (nutrients as Phosphate and Nitrate), disturbance (ice thickness) and factors affecting physiology 
(salinity and temperature)."
"Predictors were clipped to 30 m depth, the typical maximum depth distribution of the 
 species52."
"The LGM predictors considered sea level and shoreline displacements by placing the isobath of − 120 m 
below current sea  level53."
"Presence records were extracted from the fine-tuned dataset of marine forest  species54. 
"
"The same number of pseudo-absences as presences were randomly generated in sites where no presences were 
 recorded55."
"To reduce the negative effect of autocorrelation in the models, the correlation of predictors within the 
range of occurrence records (presence and pseudo-absences) was tested as a function of geographic distance."
"For 
this purpose, a correlogram was built to pinpoint the minimum distance at which predictors were significantly 
correlated."
"Records were pruned by randomly selecting one record from the pool found within such  distance56.
"
"Considering the general pattern found in the species’ genetic structure (see “ Results ”), models were developed 
separately for the northern and southern  hemispheres57."
"A tenfold cross-validation framework using independ-
ent latitudinal  bands7 was implemented to find the optimal hyperparameter combination of number of trees 
(50–1000, step 50), tree complexity (1–6) and learning rate (0.01, 0.005 and 0.001)."
"This approach also inferred the 
performance of  models58 by using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve 
and  sensitivity59."
"To reduce overfitting, models were forced to fit negative monotonic responses for maximum 
temperature and ice thickness, and positive responses for nutrients, salinity and minimum  temperature7,49,60. 
"
"The relative contribution of predictors to the models was determined by computing the increase in deviance 
explained (i.e., goodness of fit) when each predictor was added to its alternative model."
"Physiological tolerance 
limits (maximum and minimum, depending on the predictor) were estimated from individual response functions 
produced for each predictor, while fixing all alternative predictors to their  averages61,62.
"
"Parsimonious models (i.e., with fewer predictors) with higher potential for  transferability63 were built using 
a stepwise approach by fitting a full model (i.e., with all predictors) and interactively removing predictors one 
at the time, from the least to the higher contributive, until the difference of deviance explained between the full 
model and the reduced model was higher than  zero58,60,64."
"Maps reflecting the potential distribution of the spe -
cies for present-day conditions and the LGM were developed with the parsimonious models fitting the optimal 
hyperparameters."
"These maps were reclassified to binomial surfaces, reflecting presence and absence of Mac -
rocystis pyrifera, by applying a threshold maximizing both specificity (true negative rate) and  sensitivity7,58,65. 
"
"Range shifts were determined in terms of area by comparing the LGM and present modelled distributions for 
the regions where genetic sampling took place (see “ Methods ” below)."
"Regions providing glacial refugia were 
identified where the species was predicted to occur during the LGM period."
"Because the species can produce 
rafts that disperse for long periods of time over the surface of the  ocean29, predictions were also performed for 
the LGM and the present with surface  layers51.
"
Genetic structure and diversity.
"Approximately 30 individuals were sampled per site (115 sites; 3872 
individuals in total; S1) for genetic analysis, by removing a piece of the blade and preserving it in silica drying 
crystals."
"Genomic DNA extraction was performed with the NucleoSpin 96 Plant Kit II (Macherey–Nagel, Duren, 
Germany) and standard protocols."
"Microsatellite amplification and scoring was performed for 6 polymorphic 
loci using PCR conditions and methods described  in66  and39.
"
"Genetic structure between sites was inferred with Structure  software67 without a priori population assign-
ment, allowing admixture, using the model of correlated allele frequencies for a range of K clusters between 1 
and 10, a burn-in time of 2 ×  105 repetitions and 1 ×  106 iterations."
"The potential number of clusters was inferred 
with the DeltaK  criterion68, which identifies the “best” K value as the one maximizing the rate of change in the 
log probability of the data (ΔK)."
"The analysis was performed under two hierarchical  steps3,8: the first aimed to 
discover the main genetic groups when considering the entire distribution, and the second aimed to reveal the 
regional levels of genetic structure within each of the main genetic groups that resulted from the first step."
"This 
approach allows the analysis of regional genetic differentiation within the main genetic groups independently of 
their differences in allelic richness."
"Two sites showing signs of admixture in the first hierarchal step (see “ Results ”) 
were excluded from the second step to better disentangle genetic  structure3,8.
"
"Genetic structure was also inferred with a network analysis, with nodes defined by the sampled sites and 
edges by their relative number of shared  alleles69."
"Excessive network connections with surplus information were 
removed until a threshold maximizing  Modularity70."
"The leading eigenvector algorithm using the percolated 
network assigned a unique membership (i.e., cluster) to the nodes based on the edge’s distance."
"The significance 
of this process was inferred by testing the proportion of  104 random membership assignments retrieving higher 
Modularity than observed."
"Network eigenvector centrality was also determined to identify sites serving as hubs 
to gene  flow69.
"
"Genetic differentiation was determined between clusters with Jost’s D. This index was chosen in detriment of 
FST because it is more suitable for comparisons with contrasting levels of  diversity71, as in this case (see “ Results ”). 
"
"Genetic diversity per site and cluster was inferred as standardized allelic richness, gene diversity (expected 
heterozygosity) and private alleles, for the smallest sample size found in any population (excluding sizes ≤ 10) 
using  104 randomizations."

Species distribution modelling."
"The marine forests dataset retrieved 10,715 occurrence records for 
the species."
"Correlograms identified predictors autocorrelated at a minimum distance of 4 km in the northern 
group, and 9 km in the southern group, pruning a final dataset of 180 and 369 records, respectively.
"
"The distribution models included multiple predictors, from which temperatures (maximum and minimum) 
had a prominent role in explaining the distribution of both northern and southern genetic groups (combined 
relative contributions: 95.06% and 75.15%, for the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively; Table  1). 
"
"Thermal tolerance was estimated between 3.22 and 24.23 °C for the northern group and between 1.94 and 
23.98 °C for the southern group."
"The modelled distribution of the southern group was further dependent on 
nutrients above ~ 0.02 mmol.m−3 and ice thickness above 0.16 m (contributions ranging between 5.69 and 10.63%; 
Table  1)."
"An additional niche overlap analyses performed between the northern and southern groups (S2) showed 
evidence of niche conservatism in Macrocystis pyrifera (i.e., the northern and southern hemispheres display 
identical ecological niches).
"
"The models showed good potential for transferability (CV AUC  > 0.9; CV Sensitivities  > 0.9; Table  2) and 
the predictions performed for the present largely matched the known distribution of the species, as verified 
by sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate) > 0.95 and AUC > 0.94 (Table  2; Fig.  1)."
"Comparing predictions with the 
species’ realized distribution, as inferred by reports of occurrence records (Fig. 10 in S3), shows some degree 
of overprediction in Alaska (from Palma Bay to Kodiak Island, ~ 900 km coastline), Chile (from Antofagasta 
to Huasco, Atacama, ~ 500 km coastline), Southern Africa (from Paternoster, South Africa, to Kunene River, 
Namibia,  ~ 1,500 km coastline)."
"To a lower extent, overprediction was detected in Western Australia (~ 300 km 
coastline) and Southern Australia (~  400 km coastline)."
"These are regions where the species is not reported to 
occur, but where the models predicted suitable conditions based on the predictor variables considered."
"Similarly, 
the species was continuously predicted along the coastlines of Washington (USA) and Southern Oregon, where 
reports of occurrence records are elusive (Fig. 10 in S3)."
"During the LGM, the models estimated a 40% range 
contraction within the regions sampled for genetic data (Table  3)."
"During that past period, unsuitable areas might 
have occurred in the high latitudinal regions of Alaska to Washington state (USA), and throughout most of the 
Southern Ocean, Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) and Tasmania (Fig.  1; Table  3)."
"Conversely, the low latitude range 
limits might have remained stable (e.g., California to Mexico, Northern Chile, Peru, Australia and New Zealand). 
"
"Among the sampled regions, Channel Islands to Mexico was the only one predicted with wider suitable habitats 
in the LGM when compared to the present (Table  3)."
"Results also indicated that other regions, like Southeastern 
Africa, Western and Eastern Australia and Northern New Zealand, might have had wider suitable habitats for M. 
pyrifera  during the LGM (Figs. 6–9 in S3), with ranges potentially expanding beyond its present-day modelled 
distribution."
"Australia is in the same genetic group as Patagonia and the sub-Antarctic islands (see genetic results 
below), and these latter ones suffered local extinctions due to ice during the LGM, therefore the genetic group as 
a whole increased in area from the LGM to the present (Table  3), even though that was not the case in Australia.
"
"The models predicting suitable surface conditions (i.e., exclusively for rafting) showed disjunct potential 
distributions between the northern and southern hemispheres during the LGM and the present."
"Throughout 
the Southern Ocean, models showed broad suitable conditions for rafting with present-day conditions, while 
during the LGM, a discontinuity might have occurred along southern Chile and Tierra del Fuego (Argentina).

hemisphere in (1) Alaska to Point San Luis, (2) Point Conception region and (3) Channel Islands to Mexico 
(Figs.  1, 2; S3)."
"This level of structure showed admixture in Catalina Island, and depending on the selected num-
ber of clusters (2 or 4), assigned Peru (sites 73 and 74) to the northern hemisphere (cluster G3, Point Concep-
tion region) or to the southern hemisphere (Fig.  2)."
"The second hierarchical level of Structure subdivided the 
northernmost cluster (Alaska to Point San Luis) into Alaska, Canada and Monterey, and Santa Cruz to Point San 
Luis."
Admixture was mostly verified in Point Conception (sites 25 and 26; Fig.  2).
"The southern hemisphere was 
divided into a broad region including northern Chile and New Zealand, and into Patagonia, Australia and the 
Subantarctic Islands."
"The network analysis supported the two main clusters of the northern and southern hemi-
spheres (Modularity p-value test: 0.001) and showed the two sites in Peru belonging to the northern (site 74) and 
southern clusters (site 73; Fig.  2)."
"This analysis further showed Point Conception, Catalina Island and Tierra del 
Fuego (sites 25, 26, 62 and 90; Fig. 2) with higher eigenvector centrality (> 95th percentile).
"
"The two main clusters associated with the northern and southern hemispheres showed high differentiation 
(Jost’s D: 0.64; Fig.  3C)."
"At a lower level of genetic structure, Peru (admixture region) and the cluster comprising 
northern Chile and New Zealand were most differentiated among themselves and from all remaining clusters 
(Fig.  3D)."
"In terms of genetic diversity, results show allelic richness per site higher in the Channel Islands and 
San Mateo Point (USA), followed by San Diego region (USA) and Mexico (Â  > 8; S1)."
"Lower diversity values 
were found in the regions predicted as extinct during the LGM (i.e., Patagonia, throughout Marion, Gough and 
Macquarie Subantarctic Islands and in Canada and Alaska)."
"Number of private alleles were higher in the Channel 
Islands (particularly in San Clemente and Santa Barbara Islands), in the two sampled sites of Peru, in Monterey 
(USA) and New Zealand (PÂ  > 1; S1)."
"More than 50 sites distributed throughout the sampled regions exhibited 
no private alleles."
"Overall, allelic richness outside glacial refugia was always < 3, with the exception of two sites in 
Alaska (USA), and the average number of private alleles was < 1 at distances > 55 km from refugia and = 0 at dis-
tances > 150 km from refugia (Fig.  3A, B)."
"The sites Sitka (Alaska), Craig (Alaska) and Bamfield Island (Canada) 
of the northern hemisphere and Grytviken (Subantarctic Island) and Murray Channel (Tierra del Fuego) of the 
southern hemisphere distanced  > 500 km from the closest glacial refugia (Table S1)."
"Considering the first level 
of genetic clustering, results show diversity (allelic richness and number of private alleles) significantly higher 
in the northern hemisphere (Fig.  3C)."
"The second level of structure revealed higher diversity in the cluster from 
Channel Islands to Mexico and lower diversify in that of Alaska and Canada."
"In the southern hemisphere the 
number of private alleles were higher in Peru and in the northern Chile and New Zealand clusters.
"
"Discussion
The rare opportunity to study a biological model with replication of postglacial expansions in both northern and 
southern hemispheres allowed us to demonstrate that the distribution of intraspecific marine biodiversity can 
be structured by comparable evolutionary forces across the global ocean."
"By combining independent theoretical 
distribution modelling with empirical genetic data, we show how past range shifts (c. 20 Kyr ago to the present) 
shaped refugial regions in both hemispheres, where Macrocystis pyrifera retained higher and unique genetic 
diversity, and how significant post-glacial expansions left  ~ 40% of the sampled distribution with homogenous 
reduced diversity, regardless the distance to refugia."
"Genetic patterns further show the northern hemisphere 
with significantly higher genetic diversity and number of private alleles, supporting previous  hypotheses46 of 
an ancestral origin of the species in this region."
"In particular, the genetic hotspots found at the Channel Islands 
(California; putative global origin of M. pyrifera ) and in Peru (highest number of private alleles), potentially 
involved in the ancestral radiation of lineages, are suggested here as priority conservation areas under Climate 
Change Integrated Conservation Strategies for potentially endangered phylogeographic  lineages72."
"The distri-
bution of 6 distinct clusters, with strong genetic discontinuities corresponding to previously described phylo-
geographic breaks of additional species and well-known oceanographic barriers shaped by ocean currents and 
habitat discontinuities, allow making broad generalizations about the process driving marine phylogeography, 
particularly important for ecosystems structuring species.
"
Climate changes structuring genetic diversity across the hemispheres.
"The SDM approach 
showed the potential distribution of Macrocystis pyrifera (i.e., climatic suitable habitats) mainly driven by ther -
mal conditions (i.e., minimum and maximum extremes), which is typical for marine forest species modelled at 
the scales of our  study2,7."
The estimated thermal tolerance of the species between approx.
"2 and 24 °C largely 
agreed with empirical physiological  studies73,74, which together with the evidence found of niche conservatism 
between hemispheres (i.e., identical ecological niches; S2) provided strong support for the models, particularly 
important when performing temporal transferability to estimate demographic  changes57,75."
"The high perfor -
mance shown by our SDM approach is expected when using machine learning algorithms with proper hyper-
parameterization and monotonicity  constrains49, fitting biologically meaningful predictors against comprehen-
sive datasets of distribution  records7,76."
"Despite the general agreement found between predicted suitable habitats 
and reported occurrence records (i.e., high sensitivity rate), overprediction was found in Alaska, Chile, and 
Southwestern Africa, and, to a lower extent, in Western and Southern  Australia52, and along the coastlines of 
Washington and Oregon states (USA)."
"While the models predicted favorable conditions, additional predictor 
variables not considered might be preventing its occurrence."
"Specifically, the lack of rocky  substrate43, interspe-
cific  competition77, limited light  conditions78, and restricted dispersal  potential29 can be excluding the species 
from such areas predicted as suitable.
"
"Hindcasting the models to LGM climatologies estimated a 40% range contraction along the regions sampled 
for genetics."
"This was mostly evident from Alaska to Vancouver Island and throughout most of sub-Antarctic 
Islands, Southern Patagonia and Tasmania."
"Conversely, lower latitude ranges (e.g., California to Mexico, Northern  7

"
"The rate and magnitude of these changes are not uncommon for cold-temperate  species6,9–11,14, but were never 
addressed before with the same biological model exposed to the LGM conditions of both hemispheres in a SDM 
framework."
"This allowed identifying multiple mid- to low latitude refugia at global scales, for which peri-glacial 
margins largely match additional genetic studies; for instance, Vancouver Island adjacent to the Laurentide Ice 
sheet in the northern  hemisphere79 and Patagonia and the Falkland Islands in the southern  hemisphere24."
"As 
anticipated, populations within refugia showed higher and unique genetic diversity levels, as long-term persis -
tence rendered the possibility of population to accumulate and retain regional diversity  levels8,9,14,80."
"Outside refu-
gia, where range shifts might have occurred, diversity levels were always lower regardless the hemisphere, with 
private alleles reduced to negligible values < 1 at distances > 55 km of refugia, and to 0 at distances > 150 km."
"This 
skewed pattern of diversity occurring at such short distances of closest refugia (but not from the putative origin 
region; Fig. 5 in S3) likely resulted from consecutive founder effects occurring during post-glacial range expan-
sions, which have left homogeneous landscapes with lower diversity levels in the two  hemispheres81."
"This pattern 
might have been maintained by density barrier effects, halting the expansion of distinct immigrant  genes82,83.
"
"Results also highlighted the role of suitable habitat changes (i.e., predicted areas) as a proxy of effective popu-
lation size changes through  time11."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/with striking higher diversity compared to anywhere else, was the only sampled region that increased suitable 
habitats during the LGM."
"An additional study shows this region with even larger habitats (up to threefold) from 
the LGM to the mid-Holocene42."
"Large and stable habitats can potentially maintain population sizes large enough 
to counteract the genetic effects of inbreeding depression and drift over  time84."
"This contrasts with regions like 
Patagonia and sub-Antarctic islands that might have experienced severe population reductions, while not com-
plete extinct (up to 56% LGM contraction), and today show reduced diversity."
"But comparing diversity levels 
between sites / genetic groups must consider additional drivers beyond potential habitat changes through time. 
"
"For instance, the major genetic bottleneck during the colonization of the southern  hemisphere46 (see “ Discus -
sion” below on “ Global phylogeographic patterns ”) may have strongly reduced diversity of new colonized areas, 
despite the subsequent relative size of persisting refugia."
"Accordingly, outside the putative region of Macrocystis  
origin, even populations within estimated regionally persistent areas, may presently contain lower diversity than 
expected in the ancient locations of its ancestral evolutionary history.
"
"Genetic erosion within refugia can further occur due to the exposure of individuals to peripheral niche 
conditions at low latitude range margins, typically characterized by nutrient-deprived warmer  waters30,85."
"In the 
present study, Mexico (northern hemisphere) and Peru (southern hemisphere) can represent such cases."
"Despite 
being predicted within refugia, considering their high private diversity levels and SDM estimates, both regions 
show low allelic richness."
"There, studies following demographic changes of giant kelp have recurrently linked 
the extreme conditions of El Niño events to local population  extinctions32,86, which might have produced bot -
tlenecks and shifted genetic  baselines34."
"Cryptic persistence in deep colder waters or microscopic gametophyte 
stages, as suggested  elsewhere87,88, could have counteracted complete genetic losses and safeguarded the observed 
unique diversity."
"In this context, climate change scenarios are projected to shift the 24 °C isotherm matching the 
species’ thermal tolerance to more poleward regions, hundreds of km beyond these sites, particularly in the no 
mitigation scenarios overlooking the Paris Agreement  initiative89."
"The complete loss of unique genes, as recently 
reported for the Ecklonia  forests of  Oman90, is of particular  concern30, calling for considering both warm range 
edges of M. pyrifera as priority for conservation in light of Climate Change Integrated Conservation Strategies 
for potentially endangered phylogeographic  lineages72.
"
Global phylogeographic patterns.
"Results showed M. pyrifera composed by two main genetic clusters, 
which coincide with the division of both hemispheres, followed by a second and more complex level of struc-
ture comprising six clusters."
"All clusters showed significant pairwise differentiation levels, largely suggesting 
the effect of genetic drift, not compensated by regular gene flow."
"Compared to the southern hemisphere, the 
northern hemisphere showed significantly higher genetic diversity and up to fourfold more private alleles (i.e., 
genetic diversity endemic of the northern hemisphere), rendering it the potential ancient origin of the species. 
"
"This is supported by previous studies also hypothesizing the southern hemisphere distribution of M. pyrifera 
and additional cold-temperate species of macroalgae resulting from northward  introductions46,91."
"The centrality 
patterns found in both genetic structure and network analyses point to Catalina Island bridging the hemispheres 
through the region sampled in Peru, a hypothesis raised  elsewhere46."
"This process can explain the admixture 
levels found in Peru, and may have occurred by stepping-stone through unsampled tropical regions where the 
species occurred, or still occurs in elusive habitats (e.g., Socorro Island in Mexico)92, yet in a distant past beyond 
the LGM, as SDM does not suggest the possibility of rafting between the hemispheres."
"Additional temperature 
reconstructions for this tropical area match the sea surface temperature anomaly of our data during the LGM of 
approx."
"− 2 °C, reinforcing a plausible long-term barrier for rafting."
"Earlier periods like the pre- or mid-Pleisto-
cene climate transition (620–435 Kyr ago and 870–620 Kyr ago) could have provided suitable conditions for the 
stepping-stone process, as suggested for the red algae Callophyllis variegata91.
"
"Marked genetic structure hinders the inference of other colonization pathways, with the exception for the 
regions more recently colonized (i.e., Alaska, Canada and most sub-Antarctic Islands)."
"Structure and network 
analyses (degree centrality) suggest Alaska and Canada potentially originating from Monterey Bay, and the sub-
Antarctic Islands being colonized by Tierra del Fuego or a neighboring persistent location (e.g., Falkland Islands), 
where the species could have  dispersed9,24,93; this contrasts with additional persistent areas (e.g., southern Chile) 
from which dispersal might have been hindered by the major discontinuity for rafting occurring along southern 
Chile and Tierra del Fuego, as suggested by the SDM .
"
"The genetic divisions observed in both hemispheres are corroborated by previous studies of M. pyrifera38,39,46, 
and reinforce the role of oceanographic currents and habitat discontinuity shaping the genetic structure of the 
species, as previously studied along the Californian  coastline43,44."
"In the northern hemisphere, the deflection 
of the Alaska and California  currents94 can explain the division between G1 (Alaska, Canada & Monterey) and 
G2 (Santa Cruz to Point San Luis), while the well-known biogeographic barrier of Point  Conception95 defines 
a genetic cluster per se."
"In the southern hemisphere, the split of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the 
northward Humboldt current and the southward Cape Horn current shapes a barrier at − 42° latitude matching 
the observed division between Patagonia and N. Chile (G5 and G6)."
"The genetic discontinuities in this region 
were also associated with founder effects during post-glacial colonization of Patagonia for other macroalgae 
species, as well as for invertebrates and  vertebrates96–99."
"The subdivision of Peru can result from habitat disconti-
nuity shaped by extensive sandy beaches, or by the highly advective Humboldt Current System, which promotes 
off-shore transport, therefore generating a connectivity barrier to coastal populations."
"Lastly, the Tasman Sea, 
identified as a major biogeographical barrier for marine  biodiversity100, explains the additional separation of G5 
and G6, from Australia to New Zealand.
"
"Overall, the present study with replication along the northern and southern hemisphere, highlights the role 
of past climate changes at global scales in structuring refugial regions where populations may display higher and 
unique genetic diversity, compared to more recent populations resulting from post-glacial expansions."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/drivers such as regional population size changes, genetic bottlenecks produced by major phylogeographic events 
(e.g., the colonization of the southern hemisphere) and the exposure to peripheral niche conditions in warm 
range edges might have further been key to structuring global diversity levels."
"The study also highlights the role 
of major oceanographic currents and habitat discontinuities, coupled with the density barrier effects of previously 
established populations, restricting the homogenization of distinct genetic lineages over time, as suggested for 
other kelp  species3,98."
"In contrast, long-distance dispersal by rafting must be a rare  process29, but crucial to the 
colonization of unoccupied suitable habitats following glacial events."
"Together, these processes shaped disjunct 
genetic lineages at short distances (scales of tens to hundreds of km), rendering them of higher conservation 
value in the face of future climate changes, particularly if one considers the potential loss of unique alleles at low 
latitude range margins, and the multiple ecological, and socioeconomic services provided by giant kelp  forests27. 
"
"The insights provided with replication across hemispheres, contribute to a better understanding of the genetic 
effects of past climate changes, and may be generalizable to additional cold-temperate species, particularly for 
other important ecosystem-structuring species.

Continental slopes can play a significant contribution to marine productivity and carbon cycling. 
"
"These regions can harbour distinct geological features, such as salt diapirs and pockmarks, in which 
their depressions may serve as natural sediment traps where different compounds can accumulate. 
"
"We investigated the prokaryotic communities in surface (0–2 cm) and subsurface (18–20 or 22–24 cm) 
sediments from a salt diapir and pockmark field in Santos Basin, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. 
"
"Metabarcoding of 16 samples revealed that surface sediments were dominated by the archaeal class 
Nitrososphaeria, while the bacterial class Dehalococcoidia was the most prevalent in subsurface 
samples."
"Sediment strata were found to be a significant factor explaining 27% of the variability in 
community composition."
"However, no significant difference was observed among geomorphological 
features."
"We also performed a metagenomic analysis of three surface samples and analysed the 
highest quality metagenome‑assembled genome retrieved, which belonged to the family CSP1–5, 
phylum Methylomirabilota."
"This non‑methanotrophic methylotroph contains genes encoding for 
methanol oxidation and Calvin Cycle pathways, along with diverse functions that may contribute 
to its adaptation to deep‑sea habitats and to oscillating environmental conditions."
"By integrating 
metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches, we reported that CSP1–5 is prevalent in the sediment 
samples from Santos Basin slope, indicating the potential importance of methanol metabolism in 
this region."
"Finally, using a phylogenetic approach integrating 16S rRNA sequences assigned to 
Methylomirabilota in this study with those from a public database, we argued that CSP1–5 public 
sequences might be misclassified as Methylomirabilaceae (the methanotrophic clade) and, therefore, 
the role of these organisms and the methanol cycling could also be neglected in other environments.
"
"The continental margins are complex and unique environments that interconnect terrestrial and marine pro -
cesses, playing a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and  nitrogen1."
"Although continental 
shelves and slopes represent only 20% of the ocean area, these regions can account for up to 50% of marine 
 productivity2,3."
"The mineralisation of organic matter in these areas occurs at a much faster rate when compared to 
what occurs in open sea sediments, allowing the regenerated nutrients to quickly return to their natural  cycles4,5. 
"
"Continental slopes often comprise a wide range of physical and geological features that can affect the nutrient 
distribution and, consequently,  biodiversity6."
"This variability is particularly important for benthic microbial 
communities, which are known to respond to changes in nutrient availability and carbon substrate  type7."

"
Santos Basin (SB) is a marginal basin located on the Southwestern Atlantic margin.
"In this region, the con -
tinental upper to middle slope presents high declivity and is marked by numerous kilometre-scale seafloor 
features, including pockmarks and exhumed salt  diapirs8,9."
"Pockmarks are crater-like depressions formed by the 
sudden release of fluid (predominantly methane) in the form of a gas or liquid to the  surface10,11."
"In Santos Basin, 
fluid expulsion is facilitated by moving large volumes of salt, weakening the upper sedimentary  layers9."
"Due to 
gravitational forces, these salt masses show vertical movement (diapir), which may or may not be exposed on 
the marine sedimentary  surface8,12."
"The pockmark field on the SB continental slope has been reported to contain 
more than nine hundred depressions related to this geological feature and salt diapirs."
"Although the majority of 
pockmarks in this area are thought to be not actively seeping gas, acoustic data, and metal proxies have suggested 
the presence of recent to sub-recent seepage activities in some of the  pockmarks9,13–16."
"In addition, the unique 
characteristics of the seafloor in this area may provide a myriad of habitats for diverse but yet poorly explored 
microbial  communities17.
"
"Continental slopes often present high sediment accumulation and organic matter  deposition9,18."
"In addition, 
the depressions as pockmarks may serve as natural sediment  traps16, where the sedimentation of different com -
pounds can occur, including methanol, a highly abundant reduced carbon in the marine  environment19,20."
"This 
C1 hydrocarbon has a fast turnover in this environment, on the order of a few days, indicating its significance in 
biological cycles, mainly as a source of carbon and energy for methylotrophic  microorganisms21,22.
"
"Versatile metabolic capabilities provide the seafloor microbial communities with different strategies to couple 
with oligotrophic and variable conditions."
"The importance of C1 metabolism in deep-sea sediments has been 
recently suggested by Torres-Beltrán et al. 23, including methanol oxidation to formaldehyde."
"The authors also 
detected functions related to formaldehyde oxidation on the continental slope of the southern Gulf of Mexico. 
"
"Y et, the identity, metabolic capabilities, and distribution of these organisms demand further exploration."
"While 
some methylotrophic groups have been vastly studied, others have only recently emerged from metagenome-
assembled genomes (MAGs)."
"Hug et al. 24 described a genome of a non-methanotrophic methylotroph from the 
phylum Methylomirabolota (former NC10), a cluster mostly known for its nitrate-dependent methanotroph 
members, which has raised questions regarding the phylogenetic boundaries of the different methylotrophic 
groups in this phylum.
"
"In this study, we used metabarcoding and metagenomics to investigate the prokaryotic diversity in surface 
and subsurface sediments collected at the pockmark and salt diapir field on the SB continental slope."
"In addi-
tion, through genome reconstruction from metagenomic data, we described the MAG of a methylotroph from 
the order Methylomirabilales, which was widespread across SB sediments."
"We further explored its adaptations 
to the deep-sea environment and then argued its potential metabolic capabilities and roles in the carbon cycle 
along the SB continental slope.
Material and methods
Study area and sediment sampling."
"The Santos Basin (SB) is located on the southern continental mar -
gin of Brazil between latitudes 27° S and 26° N, covering an area of 3.5 ×  105  km2."
"SB is limited to the north by 
Alto de Cabo Frio and to the south by Cabo Santa Marta Grande in Alto de Florianópolis25."
"Under the hydro-
graphic point of view, the area of study is localised in the transition between two water masses, the South Atlantic 
Central Water (SACW) and the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) 33."
"The SACW (T ≤ 18.5  °C, S ≥ 35.3) 
occupies the pycnocline level, while the AAIW presents temperatures between 3 and 6 oC and salinities between 
34.2 and 34.526–28.
"
"We collected sediment samples using a stainless-steel box corer BX-650 (Ocean Instruments, San Diego, 
California, USA) (50 cm  × 50 cm) with a maximum penetration of 60 cm."
"Cylindric corers were used to collect 
sediments within the box corer while maintaining the sediment stratification."
"The sediment cores were sliced 
into 2 cm layers with sterile spatulas and placed in whirl pak bags, then stored at −20 °C until processing."
"For this 
study, we selected eight stations with bathymetry ranging from 400 to 800 m approximately, comprising three 
stations located in salt diapirs, three stations in pockmarks, and two stations in the adjacent marine seafloor 
considered as control sediments, without pockmarks and salt diapirs influence (Fig.  1)."
"We used the superficial 
(0–2 cm) and the deepest sediment layer (16–18 or 22–24 cm), from now on called surface and subsurface strata, 
respectively (Table S1).
"
Taxonomic profiling of the prokaryotic community.
"DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of sediment 
using the Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Germany), following the manufacturer’s specifications."
"DNA 
integrity was verified by electrophoresis in 1% (v/v) agarose gel, and concentration was assessed using the Qubit 
dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA)."
"The V4–V5 hypervariable region of the 
16S rRNA sequence was amplified with the universal primers 515F and  926R29,30."
"The initial PCR reaction con-
sisted of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles with 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C 
for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Library preparation and sequenc-
ing were performed by Mr DNA/Molecular Research (Shallowater, TX, USA), using Illumina Miseq platform 
(2 × 250 bp system)."
"16S rRNA sequencing data are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Informa-
tion Sequence Read Archives under BioProject ID PRJNA818533.
"
"After sequencing, paired-end reads were initially imported and demultiplexed into the QIIME2 software 
version 2019.1031."
"Graphic inspection of quality profiles was performed, low-quality reads (below Phred score 
30) were trimmed, and the chimeras were removed with the aid of the Dada2  software32."
"After quality con-
trol, the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were determined using the Dada2 software into the QIIME2 package.  "

"The normality of variances was assessed 
by Shapiro–Wilk test."
"Similarities among samples and site groups were examined using ordinated weighted 
Unifrac normalised distance and visualised by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)."
"Alpha diversity,

Metagenomic analysis for metagenome‑assembled genome (MAG) recovery.
"We performed 
shotgun metagenomic analysis of three surface sediment samples from the following stations: 259 (diapir area), 
260 (diapir area), and 255 (control area)."
"The metagenomic libraries were prepared using Nextera XT DNA 
Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and sequencing was performed in Illumina Hiseq platform 
(2 × 150 pb system) at the Woods Hole Institute’s Marine Biology Laboratory, as part of the “Deep Carbon Obser -
vatory’s Census of project Deep Life” ."
"Raw reads were filtered through the SICKLE software with phred > 30 and 
then used for genome reconstruction through the anvi’ o pipeline v. 7.134."
"Co-assembly was performed using 
the Megahit  software36, and the contigs with size > 4000 bp were selected for binning through the CONCOCT 
 software37."
"Bins were manually refined using anvi-refine34 and then quality checked with CheckM v. 1.0.738. 
"
"MAGs were taxonomically classified based on genome phylogeny according to the classify  workflow (classify_
wf) from the Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit (GTDB- Tk v. 1.3.0) and the Genome Taxonomy Database 
(GTDB; release 202)39."
"Metagenome raw sequences are available in the GenBank repository under BioProject 
ID PRJNA818670.
"
"For further analyses, we selected the MAG with the highest quality scores, the SB_MAG_00001 (94.2% com-
pleteness and 2.1% contamination), classified within the Methylomirabilota phylum (formerly NC10 phylum). 
"
Prediction and annotation of ORFs were performed using prokka v.14.540.

Construction of the phylogenetic tree.
"A phylogenetic tree was built to verify the phylogenetic rela-
tionships among members of the Methylomirabilota phylum recovered from our sediment samples through 
metabarcoding and metagenomics."
"First, we selected all sequences assigned to this phylum found in our 16S 
rRNA sequencing data (23 ASVs), and then extracted the 16S rRNA sequence from the MAG SB_MAG_00001 
using the barrnap software (version 0.9, https:// github."
com/ tseem  ann/ barrn  ap).
"In addition, 16S rRNA 
sequences were extracted from three reference genomes from the order Methylomirabilaliles, available in the 
NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information): Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera  (Ca. M. oxyfera) 
(NCBI:txid671143), Candidatus Methylomirabilis limnetica  (Ca. M. limnetica )"
"(NCBI: txid671143), and NC10 
bacterium CSP1-5 (NCBI:txid1640516)."
"Finally, we used all 16S rRNA sequences available in the SILV"
"A database 
that showed at least 95% identity with our Methylomirabilota 16S rRNA sequences and the 16S rRNA sequence 
extracted from our MAG SB_MAG_00001 (34 sequences)."
"The reference sequences from SILV A database were 
retrieved from marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
"
"All sequences were aligned using the Mega X  software42 through the clustalW algorithm that uses progres -
sive alignment  methods43."
"This algorithm calculates an approximate distance matrix between pairs of sequences 
based on alignment scores."
"The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood method with 
Bootstrap replications equal to 999.
Results and discussion
Microbial taxonomic diversity in sediments from the Brazilian continental slope."
"The 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing of the 16 samples yielded a total of 573,850 quality-filtered reads, divided into 11,034 
amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) (0.03 cut-off)."
"Of those, 9244 ASVs were assigned to Bacteria and 1788 
to Archaea."
"Richness and diversity assessed using Chao1 and Shannon indices (Table S2), did not change sig-
nificantly across the types of seabed sampled (control, diapir, pockmark) and between the two sediment strata 
(surface and subsurface strata) (Table S3).
"
"Surface sediments were dominated by the archaeal class Nitrososphaeria (Crenarchaeota) across all seabed 
types, accounting for up to 25% of the taxonomic assignments (Fig.  2)."
"Nitrososphaeria is one of the most 
widely distributed classes of Archaea, found in a diversity of  environments44,45, including marine water and 
 sediment46,47."
"It comprises chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidising taxa, which play an important role in 
the marine nitrogen and carbon  cycles48."
"Alpha and Gammaproteobacteria comprised between 11 and 18% of 
the ASVs assignments."
"These classes have also been reported as part of the dominant groups in benthic marine 
environments, including pockmark  sediments45,49–52.
"
"The class NB1-J, previously described in sediment samples from active  pockmarks52, was detected in surface 
sediments from the SB."
"The class Methylomirabilia, from the phylum Methylomirabilota (former NC10), was 
found in all surface samples, with an average abundance of approximately 2.6%."
"Members of this class have been 
identified in the most diverse environments, from freshwater to saline, and include methanotrophic and non-
methanotrophic methylotrophic  taxa24,53,54.
"
"In the subsurface samples, the Dehalococcoidia represented up to 24% of the communities."
"Some members of 
this class can perform organohalide respiration, anaerobic respiration that uses halogenated organic compounds 
as terminal electron acceptors for hydrogen  oxidation55."
"Microbial dehalogenation plays a significant role in the 
functioning of the halogen cycle, and many of these organisms are found in the marine environment, mainly 
in subsurface  sediments55,56."
"The class Phycisphaerae (phylum Planctomycetota) was also prevalent across all 
subsurface samples from SB, reaching up to 17% of the communities."
"These organisms are aerobic or facultatively 
anaerobic and colonise a wide variety of ecosystems, from aquatic to terrestrial and even extreme environments 
such as desert, saline, and thermal  soils57–60.
Desulfobacteria, a class known to contain sulphate-reduction bacteria, a key function in the sulphur cycling 
and anaerobic  respiration61, presented relative abundance between 0.2 and 9.8% of the subsurface communities. 
"
"The Methylomirabilia class, found in all analysed samples, represented approximately 1.5% of the communities in 
the subsurface samples."
"Nitrososphaeria comprised a much smaller proportion in the most profound strata than 
in the surface samples."
"By contrast, another Crenarchaeota class, the Bathyarchaeia, was found in higher propor -
tions in the subsurface sediments."
"These organisms are widely distributed and abundant in marine sediments; 
however, the environmental factors that control their distribution are currently  unclear62."
"They are metabolically 
diverse and indicated by Lazar et al. 63 as degraders of aromatic compounds and recalcitrant organic matter."
"The 
acetogenic ability to lithotrophically synthesise acetate from inorganic carbon has also been suggested through 
MAGs studies, as well as the potential ability to metabolise methane; however, these metabolisms were not yet 
confirmed by physiological studies since they were not yet cultivated in laboratory  conditions53,64.
"
"According to PERMANOV A analysis, seabed type was not a significant factor affecting the composition of the 
communities (Table S4)."
"By contrast, 27% of the community variability (p < 0.001) was explained by the vertical 
sediment strata—surface (0–2 cm) versus subsurface (16–18 cm or 22–24 cm). "
"These findings agree with previous 
studies showing remarkable differences in prokaryotic communities along the sediment strata, which is attributed 
to the sharp changes in physical and chemical conditions with  depth17,49,65,66."
"Another interesting pattern was 
revealed by NMDS ordination, where all surface sediment communities were concentrated in a tight cluster, 
indicating high similarity in their composition, while lower similarity was observed among subsurface samples 
(Fig.  3)."
"As surface sediments are under direct contact with the pelagic environment, their biotic and abiotic 
characteristics suffer stronger influences from the recent deposition processes and exchanges with the water 
column."
"This aspect also contributes to the higher availability of organic  carbon67,68."
"In addition, high-energy  5

"www.nature.com/scientificreports/The core microbiome analysis further supported these contrasting patterns for the community similarity when 
comparing surface and subsurface strata."
"In this analysis, we asked whether there would be ASVs common to all 
samples within each stratum, as well as to all samples regardless of the stratum (central core microbiome)."
"While 
80 ASVs were shared by all surface sediment samples (surface core microbiome), comprising archaeal and bacte-
rial taxa from ten different phyla, the core microbiome from the deep strata was composed of only two ASVs, 
which were also the central core microbiome, i.e., present in all samples (Table S5)."
"These two ASVs were assigned 
to the Methylomirabilaceae and Hyphomicrobiaceae families, according to SILV A database v.138."
"In two recent 
studies carried out in Santos Basin deep-sea sediments, the phylum Methylomirabolota was reported among 
the dominant groups across different bathymetries (from 450 to 1250 m)17, and in methane-enriched  areas73. 
"
"The Hyphomicrobiaceae family (Alphaproteobacteria) has been identified in several marine and non-marine 
 habitats74,75 and are morphologically and physiologically diverse, with most of their members known to perform 
aerobic chemoheterotrophic metabolism."
"However, some representatives, such as members of the genus Hypho -
microbium,  can grow anaerobically by denitrification or  fermentation75."
"Interestingly, as the Methylomirabilales, 
the family Hyphomicrobiaceae also comprises methanol assimilating  representatives24,76,77, suggesting that C1 
metabolising organisms could be widespread in the studied area."
"However, there are still many gaps in knowledge 
about the dynamics of methylotrophic microorganisms and their metabolic capabilities in deep-sea sediments.
"
"SB_MAG_00001: a Methylomirabilales methylotroph retrieved from SB surface sediment 
samples."
"The metagenomic library constructed from three surface sediment samples yielded 77,922,888 raw 
reads."
"After quality filtering, the number of reads per sample was 23,406,011 (Surface_255), 19,431,982 (Sur -
face_259) and 22,090,471 (Surface_260)."
"The co-assembly resulted in 108,018 contigs (> 1000 bp, N50 = 1492 bp), 
which were further binned into 34 MAGS: two high-, six medium-, and 26 low-quality drafts, according to 
genome quality standards suggested by Bowers et al. 78 (Table S6)."
"SB_MAG_00001 exhibited the highest quality 
parameters (completeness of 94.2% and contamination of 2.1%), and represented 0.4% of mapped reads (30× 
coverage)."
"According to the phylogenomic analysis of the GTDB-Tk, this MAG was assigned to the order Meth-
ylomirabiles, family CSP1-5 (ANI of 97.77% with CSP1-5 sp001443495 as the closest representative genome).
"
"Considering the data presented, it is noteworthy that contrasting taxonomic assignments were observed for 
members of the Methylomirabilales order retrieved by the different sequencing approaches in our study."
"While 
using SILV A v.138 database to classify 16S rRNA sequences, all ASVs from the Methylomirabilales order were 
assigned to the family Methylomirabilaceae (including one of the two ASVs from the central core microbiome). 
"
"By contrast, the genome of SB_MAG_00001 was classified within the family CSP1-5, according to GTDB-Tk. 
"
"Although Methylomirabilales is still a poorly known taxon, this difference in taxonomy may have important 
implications for our conclusions regarding microbial function and carbon cycling, as these families have distinct 
key metabolic capabilities.
"
"To date, there is no isolated culture from the order Methylomirabilales."
"The most studied organisms belong 
to the family Methylomirabilaceae (Ca. Methylomirabilis oxyfera , Ca. M. limnetica , and Ca. M. lanthanidiphila ), 
which are known to carry out anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to nitrite  reduction54,79,80."
"Unlike 
other AOM processes, they employ enzymatic machinery similar to aerobic methanotrophy, including its cen-
tral enzyme, the methane monooxygenase."
"The oxygen required for this process is produced intracellularly by 
nitric oxide (NO)  disproportionation80."
"However, this methane oxidising enzyme complex is absent in CSP1-5, 
a genome retrieved from aquifer sediment  samples24, and characterised as a non-methanotrophic methylotroph. 
"
The CSP1-5 genome shares 89% of the 16S rRNA sequence identity with Ca. M. oxyfera.
"The phylogenetic dif -
ferences described between CSP1-5 and the Ca. M. oxyfera  establish the boundaries of denitrification coupled 
with methane oxidation within the Methylomirabilota  phylum24.
"
"By inspecting the SILV A database (v.138), it is possible to verify that Methylomirabilaceae is the only family 
registered within the order Methylomirabilales in their library."
"Therefore, we asked whether the CSP1-5-like 
microorganisms in our samples could have been misclassified by the SILV"
A database.
"To answer this question, 
a phylogenetic tree was built using the SB 16S rRNA amplicon sequences classified into the Methylomirabilota 
phylum and the SSU fragments extracted from SB_MAG_00001 and from three reference genomes: Ca. M. 
oxyfera, Ca. M. limnetica and CSP1-5."
"In addition, 16S rRNA sequences downloaded from SILV A were also used 
(see methods for details)."
According to Ettwig et al.
"(2009)81, the phylum Methylomirabolota can be divided 
into four groups: A , B, C, and D ."
"Groups A  and B  are considered the dominant branches and harbour the 
anaerobic methane-oxidising microorganisms."
Members of the CSP1-5 family are housed in the group D .
"All 
other members of this phylum are allocated to clade C81."
"In the phylogenetic tree presented in Fig.  4, the 16S 
rRNA sequences clustered in three major clades: One clade was formed only by sequences extracted from the 
reference genomes of the methanotrophic taxa, Ca. M. oxyfera and Ca. M. limnetica  (both group A)54,81."
"The 
largest cluster housed 22 ASVs obtained in this study by amplicon sequencing and the sequences extracted from 
the genomes of SB_MAG_00001 and CSP1-5."
"Therefore, the clustering pattern indicates that the SB amplicon 
sequences are more closely related to CSP1-5 than the methanotrophic genomes."
"This finding suggests that those 
sequences may have been misclassified by the SILV A database and could, in fact, belong to the same family as 
SB_MAG_00001, CSP1-5."
"In addition, this large cluster also contained 34 sequences downloaded from the SILV"
"A 
database (retrieved from marine and terrestrial ecosystems) and classified within the family Methylomirabilaceae. 
"
"According to this analysis, previous studies may have inaccurately reported the presence of methane-oxidising 
microorganisms and neglected the importance of methanol metabolism in those environments (Table S7)."
"The 
third cluster comprised ten sequences from the SILV A database and only one ASV retrieved from this study by 
amplicon sequencing."
All members of this cluster belong to the order Rokubacteriales.
"Interestingly, except for 
the ASV obtained in this study, all sequences in the third clade were recovered from terrestrial environments."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Potential metabolisms and lifestyles of the SB_MAG_00001."
"SB_MAG_00001 contains complete 
or nearly complete gene sets for the following central carbon and energy metabolism pathways: glycolysis, glu-
coneogenesis, pyruvate oxidation, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and Calvin Cycle."
"The MAG contains 
genes for the lanthanide-dependent Xox-type methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), which can convert methanol to 
formaldehyde or directly to  formate82–84."
"It has also been proposed that XoxF-MDH can oxidise formaldehyde 
to  formate83."
"Several studies have suggested the widespread nature of Xox-MDH within methylotrophs, with its 
functional relevance in the environment likely comparable with the vastly studied calcium-dependent MDH 
(Mxa-MDH).
"
"The metabolic reconstruction in Fig.  5 presents the MAG’s complete pathway to oxide formaldehyde to 
formate through the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydromethanopterin-dependent route, in addition to formate dehydrogenase, 
which can oxidise formate to  CO280.  "
"CO2 can be assimilated through Calvin Cycle, the only C fixation pathway 
found in this genome and other known  Methylomirabilales80,85."
"Accordingly, the Serine Cycle for formalde-
hyde assimilation is absent."
"Using enrichment cultures and carbon isotope tracing experiments, Rasigraf et al. 
(2014)85 demonstrated that the methanotrophic M. oxyfera assimilated exogenous 13  CO2, when provided with 
CH4, indicating autotrophic  CO2 fixation."

www.nature.com/scientificreports/counterparts could also assimilate exogenous  CO2 (and not only from the formaldehyde degradation)."
"Consid-
ering the wide distribution of these organisms in the deep-sea sediments of the Santos Basin slope presented in 
our study, this could represent an overlooked primary production process in the area."
"However, experimental 
demonstration of this capability would be required.
"
"Microorganisms inhabiting continental slope sediments may endure a wide range of conditions, including 
oligotrophic environments, low temperature, and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP)."
"Such conditions may select 
organisms with suitable niches, and by exploring the metabolic potential of SB_MAG_00001 we could shed light 
into the ecology and adaptation of this microorganism."
"Living in oligotrophic sediments demands metabolic 
strategies to cope with scarce and oscillating resources."
"In this regard, methylotrophy might represent an advan-
tageous trait, considering that C1 compounds are ubiquitous in the  ocean86–89."
"In addition to methanol, other 
C1 compounds such as methane, methyl halides, methylated amines, and methylated sulphur compounds are 
also commonly found in the marine  environment89,90."
"Studies have suggested the importance of methylotrophic 
microorganisms for the turnover these C1 compounds, and that microbial activity prevents their accumulation 
in marine  sediments91,92.
"
"In addition to carbon substrate, metabolic capabilities related to nutrient cycling can reveal ecological strate-
gies to couple with the availability of reduced compounds and electron acceptors."
"For instance, SB_MAG_00001 
contains genes for the first step of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification (nar GH), pathways 
used as alternative respiratory pathways under low levels of oxygen by several  microorganisms93,94."
"Furthermore, 
nxrAB, involved in nitrite oxidation, and the gene hao , which converts hydroxylamine to nitrite, are also pre-
sent."
"As for sulphur cycling, genes related to assimilatory sulphate reduction (ASR) ( sat, cysN, cysC, sir, cysK), 
and thiosulphate oxidation (sox, doxD) were annotated."
"ASR is a fundamental metabolic route, as sulphur is 
an essential element in all organisms present in biomolecules, such as amino  acids95."
"In addition, thiosulphate 
can be an important intermediate in the sulphur cycle in marine sediments and it might be generated from the 
anoxic sulphide  oxidation96.
"
"Regarding phosphorus metabolism, genes encoding for polyphosphate kinase (PPK) and exopolyphosphatase 
(PPX) were detected."
"These enzymes are responsible for polyP accumulation and degradation, a trait that may 
confer an advantage in environments under high oscillation in phosphate availability and other stress  types97,98. 
"
"In addition, the presence of the gene for phosphonate transport (phn D) indicates a potential use of organic 
phosphorus."
"Besides phn D, other transporters provided some indications of the potential ecophysiology of this Figure 5.  Model prediction of SB_MAG_00001 metabolisms."
"The model includes potential capabilities related 
to methanol, nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) metabolisms, as well the ABC transporters and the adaptations to the 
environment."
"The model was constructed with the genes annotated by DRAM, predicted proteins annotated by 
GhostKoala and the hidden Markov model (HMM) searches (Supplementary Table 8)."

amino acids, and tungstate (Fig.  5).
"
"Under deep-sea conditions, adaptations for psychrophilic and piezophilic lifestyles may confer advantages. 
"
"Our sampling points ranged from 433 to 747 m deep where water temperatures can be as low as 5 °C for the 
Antarctic Intermediate Water  mass28."
"Some traits, such as the expression of cold and shock proteins can have 
key roles in the cold  seafloor99."
"SB_MAG_00001 contains csp A and rhl B genes, which encode for the cold-shock 
protein and cold-shock dead-box protein-A, respectively, and have been suggested to have a role in the adapta -
tion to cold  conditions100,101.
"
"One of the major findings in cellular adaptations to high hydrostatic pressure conditions is the accumula -
tion of solutes in the bacteria, which may play the role of a “piezolyte” acting as protein-stabilising  solutes102. 
Accumulation of protein-stabilising solutes, such as β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), is often observed in organisms 
living under  HHP94."
"Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (pha C), a gene related to PHB biosynthesis, is present in 
SB_MAG_00001."
"Compatible solutes can confer resistance to multiple stresses, including hydrostatic and osmotic 
 pressure103."
"Other genes related to compatible solutes were found in SB_MAG_00001: the trk system potassium 
uptake protein and the monovalent cation:H+ antiporter, and CPA1 family mrp,  for sodium efflux."
"The genes for 
TRAP-type transport system periplasmic protein (yiaO ) and trehalose synthesis (ots AB) seem to be present only 
in the CSP1-5 cluster, while the osmoprotectant transport system ( opuB C) and the mechanosensitive channels 
(ybiO) are also found in the genomes of the methanotrophic Methylomirabilales.
"
"Concluding remarks
We studied the prokaryotic communities in sediments in pockmark and salt diapir fields from the Continental 
Slope in Santos Basin."
"Using a combination of metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches associated with 
phylogenetic tools, we observed that a non-methanotrophic methylotroph from the order Methylomirabilales was 
widespread across all samples and was the highest-quality MAG retrieved."
"We explored the metabolic potential 
of this genome (classified into the family CSP1–5) and described its methanol oxidising capability, along with 
several genes with the potential to improve the fitness of the organism in the deep-sea environment."
"The wide -
spread nature of this organism suggests a potential important role of methanol metabolism in this continental 
slope area."
"We further argued whether it could contain an overlooked autotrophic  CO2 fixation pathway.
"
"The results also provide evidence that studies based only on metabarcoding may lead to misclassification of 
the members of the Methylomirabilales, which has profound relevance for the conclusions regarding the roles 
of the organisms in the environment, as the order contains methanotrophic (Methylomirabilaceae) and non-
methanotrophic (CSP1–5) members."
"Ribosomal sequences misclassified as Methylomirabilaceae were retrieved 
from various environments, and, therefore, the relevance of methanol metabolism may be neglected in previous 
studies.

www.nature.com/scientificreportsExceptional population genomic 
homogeneity in the black 
brittle star Ophiocomina nigra 
(Ophiuroidea, Echinodermata) 
along the Atlantic‑Mediterranean 
coast

The Atlantic ‑Mediterranean marine transition is characterised by strong oceanographic barriers and 
steep environmental gradients that generally result in connectivity breaks between populations from 
both basins and may lead to local adaptation."
"Here, we performed a population genomic study of 
the black brittle star, Ophiocomina nigra, covering most of its distribution range along the Atlantic ‑
Mediterranean region."
"Interestingly, O. nigra is extremely variable in its coloration, with individuals 
ranging from black to yellow‑orange, and different colour morphs inhabiting different depths and 
habitats."
"In this work, we used a fragment of the mitochondrial COI  gene and 2,374 genome‑wide 
ddRADseq‑derived SNPs to explore: (a) whether the different colour morphs of O. nigra represent 
different evolutionary units; (b) the disruptive effects of major oceanographic fronts on its population 
structure; and (c) genomic signals of local adaptation to divergent environments."
"Our results revealed 
exceptional population homogeneity, barely affected by oceanographic fronts, with no signals of 
local adaptation nor genetic differentiation between colour morphs."
"This remarkable panmixia likely 
results from a long pelagic larval duration, a large effective population size and recent demographic 
expansions."
"Our study unveils an extraordinary phenotypic plasticity in O. nigra, opening further 
research questions on the ecological and molecular mechanisms underpinning coloration in 
Ophiuroidea.
"
"The Atlantic-Mediterranean biogeographic marine region encompasses a wide range of subtropical, temperate 
and even subarctic marine areas that also includes several environmental transition zones and oceanographic 
 fronts1–4."
"One of these relevant oceanographic transitions is the English Channel, which brings the southern 
Atlantic water mass into contact with the colder and shallower North  Sea5,6."
"In the southern European area, 
the Strait of Gibraltar and the Almeria-Oran front define two oceanographic breaks, due to the strong and 
well-defined marine circulation system across this area, that separate the Atlantic and the Mediterranean 
 basins6,7."
"These two barriers delimit the Alboran Sea, a mixing-water zone between the warmer and saltier 
Mediterranean Sea and the lower-salinity and colder Atlantic  Ocean8."
"Depending on the species, these marine 
barriers have different effects on the connectivity and gene flow patterns between Atlantic and Mediterranean 
 populations6,7,9–14, thus providing different disruptive effects of these two oceanographic  barriers3,9,10,12,13,15–18. 
"
"Genetic diversity patterns highlighted that large- and short-scale oceanographic circulation interplays with 
each species life history traits and its evolutionary history to determine its divergence  level3,6,19,20."

"www.nature.com/scientificreports/it is mandatory to obtain genetic data from a wide range of species displaying a variety of biological traits and 
evolutionary histories, to extract general conclusions about the effects of oceanographic breaks on population 
connectivity, as well as the relative importance of each factor involved in the divergence patterns.
"
"Although an array of studies on population genetics, phylogeography and speciation have been performed 
along the Atlantic-Mediterranean  coast9–17,21–24, some animal groups, such as the ophiuroids (Ophiouroidea, 
Echinodermata) have been less studied."
"Ophiuroids, commonly known as brittle stars, are the most diverse 
echinoderm class, with important ecological roles in marine benthic food webs that occupy a large range 
of ecological and trophic niches in all oceans around the  world25–27."
"To date, only a few studies on genetic 
connectivity and structure of ophiuroid populations along the European coast have been performed with 
nuclear  markers28–30, whereas most studies were exclusively based on mitochondrial  DNA18,31."
"These studies 
showed contrasting patterns of population divergence that were largely influenced by the reproductive strategy 
of the studied species (brooding versus  non-brooding species), among other biological factors."
"Additionally, 
ophiuroids usually present cryptic species  complexes18,27,29,30,32–35, and several cryptic species have been reported 
along the European Atlantic and Mediterranean coast for the genus Ophioderma  (O. longicauda   complex30,33–35, 
Ophiothrix18,31, and Amphipholis  (A. squamata species  complex28,29)."
"Cases of overlooked diversity have also been 
reported, where different species had been mistakenly considered colour phases of the same  species32, due to the 
generally large morphological plasticity found in this marine invertebrate  group18,36,37.
"
"Despite their high diversity and ecological relevance, genomic research on brittle stars is still on its infancy 
compared to other echinoderm classes."
"For instance, only three out of the 45 echinoderm genome assemblies 
available on NCBI are from ophiuroid species (https:// www."
ncbi. nlm.
"nih. gov/ assem  bly, checked in February 
2023)."
"This general lack of genomic information prevents the implementation of genomic approaches that rely on 
reference genomes, which have remarkable applications on population genomics, evolution and  conservation38,39. 
"
"Nevertheless, reduced representation library techniques, such as restriction-site associated DNA sequencing 
(RADseq), enable the isolation of thousands of nuclear markers for population genomic analyses of non-model 
 organisms40."
"Indeed, RADseq techniques have been successfully applied to a wide variety of non-model marine 
invertebrate species in absence of reference genomes: from  sponges41 to  molluscs42."
"In line with the lack of 
genomic resources for Ophiuroidea, there are only three studies using RADseq techniques on brittle stars, all of 
them focused on Antarctic  species43–45.
"
"In this work, we carry out a phylogeographic and population genomic study of the brittle star Ophiocomina 
nigra , for which different biological traits such as the feeding and social  behaviour46,47, bioluminescence  activity48, 
and secretory  systems49,50 have been explored."
"O. nigra  presents a wide distribution including the Mediterranean 
Sea and the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean, from the Azores Islands to  Norway37,47, from shallow waters to 
relatively deep habitats (400 m)."
"It is a slow-growing species that lives up to 14 years, and juveniles tend to settle 
far from  adults51."
"O. nigra  has a planktotrophic larva that remains in the water column for several months before 
its settlement, and therefore, with a potentially high dispersal  ability47."
"Both field observations and laboratory 
experiments determined that O. nigra  forms low-density and regular dispersed patches on the marine floor in 
the English Channel, where individuals avoid contact with each other, a social behaviour that largely differs from 
other co-occurring brittle stars such as Ophiothrix fragilis ."
"However, O. nigra  aggregations with densities over 
100 individuals·m−2 might be induced by environmental disturbances or under presence of  food47.
"
"Interestingly, O. nigra  presents an impressive colour variation, with individuals ranging from black to yellow-
orange, and some organisms also presenting reddish  hues52."
"In fact, dark and light colour morphs were once 
considered different species: the light-coloured morph was initially described as Ophiocoma raschi  (Sars, 1871), 
but was later synonymised with O. nigra53."
"In the southern coast of Great Britain, the distribution of colour 
morphs has been related to depth, with darker colour morphs appearing more often at shallower areas and light-
coloured individuals becoming more common in deeper  waters52."
"Coloration of O. nigra  depends on the oxidation 
state of a melanin pigment present in specialised melanin-containing cells of the integument, the melanocytes, 
which might be regulated by fluorescent pigments and an enzyme system controlling  melanogenesis54."
"These 
differences in coloration, habitat preference and physiology could be due to phenotypic plasticity of a single 
species or, contrarily, they may indicate that they are in fact two different species, hypotheses that have not 
hitherto been contrasted from a genetic perspective.
"
"In the present study, we sequenced a mitochondrial marker and isolated thousands of nuclear markers using 
a RADseq approach, in order to achieve the following objectives: (a) testing whether the two colour morphs of 
O. nigra  are underpinned by genetic differences, and hence they should be considered different evolutionary 
units within a cryptic species complex; (b) assessing the genetic diversity, demographic history and population 
structure of O. nigra , focusing on the effects that multiple oceanographic barriers may have on its population 
connectivity; and c) looking for genomic signals of local adaptation to different environments."
"Our first 
hypothesis is that the two colour morphs of O. nigra  may correspond to two cryptic species, as cryptic speciation 
is common in Ophiuroidea (e.g.18,34)."
"Also, we anticipate high differentiation between distant localities due to 
the strong oceanographic barriers present in our study area."
"And finally, we expect to find genomic signals of 
local adaptation due to the contrasting habitats and sharp environmental gradients present in our sampling area.
"
"Results
We collected 192 Ophiocomina nigra  individuals from 10 localities in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea, the 
Alboran Sea, and the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean (see Fig.  1 and Table  1)."
"We identified 31 individuals that 
belonged to the light colour morph and 161 specimens that belonged to the dark colour morph."
"All individuals 
collected from Kristineberg (KRI; in Sweden) and from Blanes (BLA; in the NW Mediterranean, at 100–150 m 
depth) were those identified as belonging to the light colour morph."
"A fragment of 803 bp of the cytochrome c 
oxidase subunit I (COI ) was amplified and sequenced for all organisms."

"After filtering the

"The final dataset included 2,374 neutral SNPs and 109 individuals, containing 30.46% of 
missing data and an average depth of 9.6 reads per SNP per sample.
"
"We detected a total of 124 outlier SNPs using Arlequin, as potential candidates under positive selection. 
"
"However, no SNP was identified as under selection using Bayescan."
"Therefore, since we did not find common 
SNPs between the two methods, all SNPs were considered as neutral for subsequent population genomic analyses.

"Plot  257 results using the folded site frequency spectrum derived from the SNP dataset revealed the 
particular timing when the most recent population expansion occurred (Fig.  4B)."

between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago.
"
"Discussion
The study here presented is the first exploring the population genomic structure, phylogeography, and 
demographic history patterns of the brittle star Ophiocomina nigra ."
"To date, genome-wide scans for population 
genomics of ophiuroids only focused on three Antarctic  species43,44."
"Although O. nigra  has been deemed as 
uncommon in the Mediterranean  Sea37,52, we report here populations in our Mediterranean sampling sites."
"We 
suggest that this is not due to a recent expansion of this species into the Mediterranean Sea in the last 80 years, 
as we did not find strong genetic signals of founder effects."
"We consider that the Mediterranean populations 
were overlooked in the past.
"
"Our population genomic results, based on 2,374 ddRADseq-derived SNPs and a fragment of the 
mitochondrial COI marker, revealed population homogeneity across the whole study area, from the cold waters 
of the Northeastern Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea."
"Our results demonstrated that the two different 
colour morphs present in O. nigra  correspond to a single evolutionary unit, as no genetic divergence was observed 
between them."
"These results contrast with the high number of cryptic speciation events detected in other brittle 
stars in the same geographical area, such as Ophiothrix   spp18,31, Ophioderma longicauda  and Amphipholis 
squamata  species  complexes30,34."
"Hence, our results point to a large phenotypic plasticity as the driver of the 
morphological differences found between O. nigra  colour morphs."
"As previously suggested, colour variation in 
O. nigra  may depend on the specific environment where an organism  lives52."
"In general, individuals inhabiting 
shallower depths tend to exhibit darker colours, whereas in deeper habitats, the individuals have lighter  tones52. 
"
"These differences in pigmentation have been associated with the higher melanin production that individuals 
from shallower habitats present as a form of sun  protection52,58."
"Another factor that has been suggested to affect 
body coloration in O. nigra  is the substrate  characteristics52."
"However, we cannot test this hypothesis because no 
details on the substrate type were collected during our sampling.
"
"Despite this morphological variation within the species, and the large geographical range explored, we found 
general population homogeneity."
"We detected high levels of genetic diversity for both the mitochondrial COI  
fragment and the nuclear SNPs, but no population divergence (see Figs.  1, 2 and 3 )."
"The major oceanographic 
fronts included in our study area, the English Channel, the Gibraltar Strait, and the Almería-Oran front had 
a minor disruptive effect on the population structure of O. nigra , a result that contrasts with those observed 
in most coastal benthic species (e.g.3,7,18), including other brittle  stars18."
"Such a pattern of panmixia, or low 
genetic divergence, between the Mediterranean and Atlantic basins, or within the Mediterranean sub-basins 
is relatively common in echinoderms with large dispersal  potential15,21,59 and in those with a predominance 
of asexual  reproduction9,17."
"Nevertheless, the absence of divergence found in O. nigra  between the Northeast 
Atlantic and the Mediterranean is an exceptional pattern even for species with large dispersal  potential12,14,15,21,59. 
"
"Past oceanographic processes across the Atlantic-Mediterranean  transition6, and the current disruptive effect of 
major oceanographic circulation across the Gibraltar Strait and the Almería-Oran front, have generated a large 
variety of genomic patterns in marine invertebrates, but most of them are characterised by a major divergence 
between these two main  basins12,14,16, although exceptions also  exist31."
"Interestingly, within the Ophiothrix  species 
complex, Ophiothrix  sp. II displayed a lack of genetic divergence similar to that obtained in O. nigra , with genetic Figure 4.  "

www.nature.com/scientificreports/homogeneity along the Atlantic-Mediterranean  transition18,31."
"However, for Ophiothrix  sp. II the sampling area 
was restricted to the Iberian Peninsula and only two mitochondrial markers were  studied18.
"
"The lack of significant differentiation between distant geographical areas in O. nigra  may result from the 
combination of different biological features, demographic and historical events, including a large dispersal 
potential of the larva, large effective population size, and past demographic  expansions14,18,31."
"The planktotrophic 
larva of O. nigra  remains in the water column for several months avoiding settlement near  adults51, and hence 
can be dispersed hundreds of kilometres by marine  currents47."
"A long dispersal potential during early life stages, 
which interacts with oceanographic circulation, significantly boosts population  connectivity60."
"Additionally, 
the low-density and regularly dispersed patches formed by O. nigra  across large spatial  areas47 may favour 
connectivity along distant sites.
"
"The population homogeneity found in O. nigra  could be also the result of the recent demographic expansions 
that we identified from both COI  and SNPs datasets."
"Our demographic history analyses identified a recent 
effective population expansion consisting in two growth periods, likely related to expansions during Pleistocene 
interglacial periods (e.g.12,18)."
"The ancient growth period was recovered from both the COI  BSP and the 
ddRADseq Stairway Plot 2 results, and was dated between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago, similar to that dated 
for Ophiothrix   spp18 and some other Mediterranean  species61."
"The most recent one was also identified by both 
datasets, and pointed to a tenfold increase of O. nigra  populations between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago (see 
Fig.  4)."
"This coincides with the deglaciation period that followed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)62, and is the 
most common post-LGM population expansion pattern found in other marine invertebrates (see an example 
 in61)."
"This recent demographic expansion could have partially erased previous population differentiation in O. 
nigra , favouring the current genetic homogeneity found in both datasets."
"Additionally, a large effective population 
size reduces genetic drift  effects63, reducing genetic differentiation between populations and increasing genetic 
homogeneity.
"
"Despite the general pattern of population homogeneity found in O. nigra , the presence of sub-regional 
private haplotypes in the COI marker suggested a certain degree of genetic substructuring in major geographical 
areas."
"In agreement with these results, migration analyses based on ddRADseq-derived SNPs showed that gene 
flow is not symmetric and homogeneous over our study area."
"The migration network (Fig.  3C) showed that 
Kristineberg (KRI) was isolated from all other sites, whereas Roscoff (ROS) and the NW Mediterranean sites 
were all connected to two sites from the Alboran Sea, Tarifa (TAR) and La Herradura (HER)."
"This asymmetric 
migration pattern reveals a disruptive effect of the Gibraltar Strait or the Almería-Oran front on gene flow. 
"
"Therefore, the role of the Alboran Sea as a transitional area connecting these two major basins, the Mediterranean 
Sea and the Atlantic  Ocean3,9,15,22, is also found in O. nigra .
"
"Finally, against our initial expectations, we did not find genomic signals of selection and/or local adaptation 
in O. nigra  across our studied area, which covers important temperature and salinity clines."
"This result in O. 
nigra  contrasts with those from other echinoderms that displayed signals of selection and local adaptation to 
temperature and  salinity15,21, even under high levels of gene flow."
"However, due to the small proportion of the 
genome that is covered by RADseq approaches, strong selection associated with environmental variables might 
be affecting other genomic regions that remained uncovered in this  study64.
"
"Overall, our study shows an exceptionally high genetic homogeneity in O. nigra , barely disturbed by 
the disruptive effects of the English Channel, the Gibraltar Strait and the Almería-Oran front."
"This genetic 
homogeneity likely results from a combination of a long pelagic larval duration, a large effective population size, 
and recent demographic expansions."
"Our study also demonstrates that the different colour morphs present in 
O. nigra  are the result of high phenotypic plasticity of the species, opening new questions for further research 
investigating the ecological and molecular mechanisms behind this intriguing plasticity.
"
"Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction and sequencing."
"A total of 192 specimens of Ophiocomina nigra  were 
sampled across the natural distribution range of the species, from 10 different localities throughout the 
Atlantic-Mediterranean region between 2014 and 2017 (see details in Fig.  1 and Table  1)."
"Specimens were 
collected between 5–20 m depth by SCUBA diving for most localities, except for those from Blanes (BLA, NW 
Mediterranean), which were collected by local fishermen trawling between 100–150 m depth."
"All samples were 
preserved in absolute ethanol at room temperature until further processing.
"
"Among all samples, we identified the two colour morphs previously described for this species and likely 
associated with depth (see Table  3  in19)."
"See collection details in Table  1.

Mitochondrial COI marker sequencing.
"Genomic DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved tube feet using 
the REDExtract-N-Amp Tissue extraction kit protocol (Sigma-Aldrich, www. sigma."
com).
"Specific primers 
for a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI ) marker of O. nigra  were designed 
using Primer v. 3. 0"
(http:// simge ne.

"These newly designed primers were: Onig-F (5′-AGT  CGG TGA  TTA  TTT  TCT  ACAA-3′) and 
Onig-R (5′-AAT  TAT  CAT  TGT  AGC AGC AGTG-3′)."
"PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturalization at 
94 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 
5 min. The PCR-amplified products were bi-directionally sequenced at Macrogen Europe."

"A subset of 144 specimens from eight representative 
O. nigra  populations, was used to generate double digest restriction site associated DNA (ddRAD) libraries 
 following67."
"High molecular weight DNA was re-extracted from preserved samples following a modified 
cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB)  protocol68."
"Briefly, tube feet tissue samples were digested overnight at 
57 °C in CTAB buffer (2% w/v CTAB, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM"
"Tris- HCl, pH 8), 2-mercaptoethanol 
and Proteinase K. DNA was subsequently isolated with 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with 
ice-cold ethanol."
"DNA integrity, purity, and quantity were checked in agarose electrophoresis gels, Nanodrop 
(Thermo Fisher), and using a Qubit DNA HS assay (Life Technologies), respectively."
"For ddRAD library 
preparation, we double digested 510 ng of DNA per sample using high-fidelity restriction enzymes EcoRI and 
MseI (New England Biolabs)."
"Fragments per sample were purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckham 
Coulter) before ligation with barcoded Illumina adapters."
"Samples with unique adapters were pooled, and each 
pool was size-selected (200 to 400 bp) using a Blue Pippin (Sage Science)."
"Illumina multiplexing indices were 
added to each library during PCR amplification with a Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase kit (New England 
Biolabs), using a common forward primer (PCR1) and a reverse library-specific primer (indexed PCR2)."
"Six 
libraries, with 24 individuals per library, were paired-end sequenced (150 bp) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at 
the Novogene Core Facility, Cambridgeshire, UK.
Quality filtering, locus assembly and SNP calling were conducted using the Stacks pipeline v. 2.5969."
"RAD-
tags (DNA fragments with the two appropriate restriction enzyme cut sites that were selected, amplified, and 
sequenced) were processed using process_radtags, where raw reads were quality-trimmed to remove low quality 
reads, reads with uncalled bases, and reads without a complete barcode or restriction cut site."
"After these filtering 
steps, we retained a total of 272,024,358 reads from the initial 307,074,382 raw reads, with an average of 1,889,058 
reads per sample."
"Then, the core Stacks pipeline was run with optimised parameters  following70  and71."
"Optimal 
parameter values were: m = 3, M  = 4, and n = 4."
"The Stacks population module was used to conduct a first filtering 
of the data, retaining SNPs present in at least 50% of the individuals (r = 0.5) and with a minimum allele frequency 
higher than 0.05 (–min-maf 0.05)."
"We also used the “–write-single-snp” option in order to retain only the first 
SNP from each RAD-tag to prevent the inclusion of physically linked loci in the dataset."
"We then filtered out 
individuals with less than 20% of the loci using the adegenet R  package72."
"Then, we used the perl script “filter_
hwe_by_pop.pl” from the dDocent  pipeline73 with default parameters (-h 0.001, -c 0.25) to filter SNPs deviating 
from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium within sampling stations.
"
"The identification of putative SNPs under selection was performed using Arlequin v. 3.574 and Bayescan v. 
2.175."
"Arlequin was run with default parameters using 100,000 coalescent simulations and 100 demes."
"Benjamini-
Y ekutieli FDR corrections were applied to 0.01 p-value."
"Bayescan was run with default parameters, using the 
-snp flag and a false discovery rate of 0.05 (FDR = 0.05)."
"Only SNPs identified by both methods were considered 
as being under selection and removed from the neutral SNP dataset used for subsequent population genomic 
analyses.
"
Population structure and genetic diversity analyses.
Mitochondrial COI gene fragment.
"We 
calculated diversity indices for the COI  data, including haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (π), the 
number of haplotypes for the different populations (H), and number of private haplotypes per sampling site, 
colour morph and region using DnaSP v. 5.1076."
"The software PopART 77 was used to construct an un-rooted 
haplotype network using the TCS statistical parsimony network  approach78.
"
"Pairwise  FST indices were estimated between sampling stations using Arlequin with 90,600 permutations to 
determine their associated p -values."
"We used a Benjamini-Y ekutieli false discovery rate correction for multiple 
 comparisons79 and an overall corrected 0.05 α-level."
"In order to test whether the groupings of samples by colour 
morph or by region explained a significant part of the total genetic variation we performed two analyses of 
molecular variance (AMOV A) in Arlequin.
"
Neutral ddRAD data.
"Indices of genetic diversity including mean number of alleles, expected heterozygosity 
(He), observed heterozygosity (Ho), inbreeding index  (FIS), and the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium were 
estimated by sampling site, colour morph and region using GenoDive v. 3.0580.
"
Pairwise FST indices and AMOV
"As were also estimated for the ddRADseq-derived SNP dataset using Arlequin 
as detailed above."
"Population structure was assessed using STRU  CTU  RE v. 2.3.455 and the discriminant analysis 
of principal components (DAPC)56 as implemented in the adegenet R  package72."
"STRU CTU  RE was run using 
the admixture model for 500,000 MCMC iterations, with a burn-in of 50,000 iterations, setting the number of 
clusters (K) from 1 to 9, with 10 replicates per K. We used STRU CTU RE  HARVESTER81 to inspect the most 
likely number of K, and  CLUMPAK82 to average individual’s membership coefficients across replicates and 
graphically represent STRU  CTU  RE results."
"The DAPC was performed estimating the number of clusters with 
the find.clusters function in adegenet, using the optim.a.score function to optimise the number of retained PCs. 
"
"Additionally, in order to identify gene flow patterns, a relative migration network analysis was conducted with 
the divMigrate function in the diveRsity R  package83,84 using Nei’s GST method.

empirical data fitted an expansion model we calculated the raggedness (r)  index88 using 10,000 permutations. 
"
"Our priors for the BSP model included the implementation of the substitution model previously defined by 
jModelTest v. 2.1.1089 (HKY + I + G), a strict clock model, and the constant skyline model."
"As no molecular clock 
has been calibrated for ophiuroids, a mutation rate of 1.01% per nucleotide per million years was used for the 
COI, following other studies in echinoderms and the most recent estimations for this  group90."
"Analyses were 
run for 500 million generations, with a sampling frequency of 50,000 generations, and a burning of 25% of the 
MCMC."
"The software Tracer v.1.7.291 was used for assessing stationarity of the MCMC, effective sample sizes 
(ESSs > 200) and generating the evolution of effective population size under the skyline plot model, expressed 
as NeT (T  = generation time) over time.
"
"Additionally, we ran Stairway Plot  257 using the ddRADseq-derived SNP dataset."
"Firstly, we obtained a new 
vcf file using the Stacks populations module only applying the -r 0.5 option."
"From this vcf file we obtained 
the folded Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) using the easySFS software (https:// github."
"com/ isaac overc  ast/ easyS  
FS) with 114 projections."
"We prepared the blueprint file for Stairway Plot 2 using the following parameters: 
"
"nseq = 114; L = 3,415,039 (from the populations module output); whether_folded = true; smallest_size_of_
SFS_bin_used_for_estimation  = 1 (to include singletons in the analysis); nrand  = 28, 56, 84, 112; ninput  = 200; 
mu = 9.4e−9 (nuclear mutation rate for other  echinoderms92); year_per_generation = 7."
"Results were plotted 
using the ggplot2 R  package93.
"
"Data availability
COI  sequences and Illumina raw reads for all individuals are available on NCBI GeneBank (Accession 
Numbers: OQ152818-OQ152942) and SRA database (BioProject ID PRJNA938024; Samples SAMN33423011-
